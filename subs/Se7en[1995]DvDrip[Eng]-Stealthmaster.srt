1
00:00:58,102 --> 00:01:01,147
Neighbors heard them screaming
at each other, like, for two hours.

2
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,483
Nothing new. Then they
heard the gun go off.

3
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:04,817
Both barrels.

4
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:08,237
A crime of passion.

5
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:10,073
Yeah.

6
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,825
Just look at all the
passion on that wall.

7
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:15,912
Yeah, well, this is a
done deal. All but the paperwork.

8
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,542
The kid see it?

9
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,127
What?

10
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:24,962
The kid.

11
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:26,839
What kind of fucking
question is that?

12
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:32,470
We are all gonna be real glad when we get
rid of you, Somerset, you know that?

13
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,681
There's always these questions
with you. Did the kid see it?

14
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:38,392
Who gives a fuck? He's dead.
His wife killed him.

15
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,354
Anything else has nothing
to do with us.

16
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,864
Detective Somerset?

17
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,992
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,578
Lieutenant, I apologize
for interrupting like this...

19
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:00,373
...just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,958
Look, um...

21
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,501
Mills?

22
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:06,379
I thought we might
find a bar someplace. Sit, talk--

23
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:08,422
I'd like to get to the precinct.

24
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:11,676
You know, not much time
for this transition thing.

25
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:15,596
I meant to ask you something,
when we spoke on the phone before.

26
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:16,973
Yeah.

27
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,725
Why here?

28
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:21,561
I don't follow.

29
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:24,772
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

30
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,693
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

31
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,736
I guess for the same reasons as you.

32
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:34,115
Or the same reasons you had
before you decided to quit, yeah?

33
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:38,202
You just met me.

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,414
Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.

35
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,208
It's very simple.

36
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,754
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

37
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:51,299
I've just never seen it done
that way before.

38
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:53,885
I thought I could do some good.
It would be great...

39
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:56,762
...if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

40
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:01,934
If you're calling the shots, lieutenant--
Yes.

41
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,314
I want you to look
and I want you to listen, okay?

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,941
Now, I wasn't standing around
guarding the Taco Bell.

43
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:11,194
I've worked Homicide five years.
Not here.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,403
I understand that.

45
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,116
Well, over the next seven days, detective,
you'll do me the favor of remembering that.

46
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,631
Hey, hey. I almost died.

47
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,240
Shut the fuck up down there!

48
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,384
Hello? Yeah.

49
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,969
Okay.

50
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,388
Say it again.

51
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:13,686
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

52
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,318
Serpico's gotta go.

53
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:25,364
Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid
of this little crusty.

54
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,158
This eye, Serpico.

55
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:28,784
Did you get it?
Got it.

56
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,286
Good.

57
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,012
Coffee?
No?

58
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:55,561
Nothing's been touched.
Everything's like I found it.

59
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,396
What time was death established?

60
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,064
Like I said...

61
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,566
...I didn't touch anything.

62
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:04,737
But he's had his face in a plate of
spaghetti for about 45 minutes now.

63
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:07,656
Wait a minute.
No one bothers with vital signs?

64
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:08,991
Did I stutter?

65
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,536
This guy ain't breathing unless he
started breathing spaghetti sauce.

66
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:15,915
So that's how it's done around here?
I beg your pardon, detective.

67
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:19,084
But this guy's been sitting
in a pile of his own piss and shit.

68
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,420
If he wasn't dead,
he would've stood up by now.

69
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,756
All right, thank you, officer.
Okay.

70
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,758
Thank you.

71
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:36,852
I wonder.

72
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:43,067
What exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?

73
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,276
Don't know.

74
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:48,364
How many times has Barney Fife
found dead bodies that weren't dead?

75
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,408
Drop it.

76
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:17,643
Oof.

77
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:25,359
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

78
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,128
<i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>

79
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:46,672
Oof.

80
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,181
Who said this was murder?

81
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,225
No one.

82
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,522
Guy's heart's gotta be the size
of a canned ham.

83
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:11,989
If this isn't a coronary,
well, ha, ha, I don't know.

84
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:30,841
Whoops.

85
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,350
How about that?

86
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,986
We had this case once.

87
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,031
Guy dead on the ground.

88
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:55,366
Knife in his back.

89
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:57,576
Gotta be murder, right?

90
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,412
Fuck.

91
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,791
Anyway,
big insurance policy involved, yeah?

92
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:08,671
So the guy took the tip of the blade,
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

93
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:12,508
And he must've screwed up a few times
because there was multiples back there.

94
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,593
Could you please be quiet?

95
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:25,145
Wait a minute.

96
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,689
What?

97
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,235
Got a bucket here.

98
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:32,945
What's in it?

99
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,825
Agh!

100
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,910
Oh, God.

101
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:41,704
Fucking vomit.

102
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,290
Any blood in it?

103
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,502
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

104
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:55,634
Are you thinking it's poison?

105
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:59,179
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

106
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:00,973
Thinking it's poison, Somerset?

107
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,601
You girls have got Forensics
waiting outside.

108
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:08,689
Don't know if we'll all fit, though.
There's room, light's the problem.

109
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:10,649
Hi, how are you?
Hey.

110
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:15,112
Detective Mills, would you go help
the officers question the neighbors?

111
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:20,325
What?
Send in Forensics on your way out, please.

112
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,968
He's dead.

113
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,013
Thank you, doctor.

114
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:50,189
You've seen my files, right?
You seen the things I've done.

115
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,815
Nope.

116
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,653
I did my time on door-to-doors
and walking the beat.

117
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,156
I did that shit for a long time.

118
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,033
And?

119
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,536
Badge on my belt says "detective."
That's the same as yours.

120
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,415
Look, I made a decision.

121
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:11,418
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene.

122
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:15,297
Couldn't worry whether you thought you
were getting enough on the playing field.

123
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:16,840
Hey, man...

124
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:21,595
...just don't be jerking me off,
that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.

125
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:29,937
He's been dead a long time.

126
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,147
And I can tell you,
it was not from poison.

127
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:33,482
Oh, man.

128
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,818
How does someone
let themselves go like that?

129
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,571
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

130
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,785
How'd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door?

131
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:46,954
Please.
It's obvious he was a shut-in.

132
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,539
Now, look at this.

133
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,249
See how big this stomach is?

134
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:53,252
And the strange thing is,
it stretches.

135
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:56,630
Here. Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food--

136
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:59,883
Wait, I see what you're pointing out,
but that means nothing to me.

137
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,512
Okay. He's got lines of distention
across the duodenum.

138
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,598
And the interior
wall is ripped open.

139
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:09,268
This man ate till he burst?

140
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:11,937
He didn't really burst.
Not all the way.

141
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:14,565
He was hemorrhaging internally.

142
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:18,944
And there was a hematoma in the rectus
and transverse abdominis muscles.

143
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,445
So he did die by eating.

144
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,155
Yes and no.

145
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:25,868
What about these bruises up here?

146
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:29,538
Well, I haven't
figured that out yet.

147
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,582
Gun pressed against his head?

148
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,083
Pressed hard enough, sure.

149
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,710
Fuck,yeah.

150
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:37,796
Marks from the front side,
flush with the muzzle.

151
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:43,385
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

152
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,807
Killer put a bucket
beneath him, kept on serving.

153
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:50,350
Took his time, too.

154
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:53,270
Coroner said this could've gone on
more than 12 hours.

155
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:56,732
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort.

156
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,776
And there was definitely a point
when he passed out.

157
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:02,487
That's when the killer kicked him
and he burst.

158
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:04,615
Oof.
Sadistic fucker, huh?

159
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,200
When you want somebody
dead, you drive by and shoot.

160
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:10,412
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this.

161
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,373
Unless the act itself has meaning.
Come on.

162
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:17,336
Somebody had a problem with the fat
boy and decided to torture him.

163
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:18,503
Simple as that.

164
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,672
In the grocery bags,
we found two receipts.

165
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,175
That means the killer stopped
in the middle...

166
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:25,469
...and made a second trip
to the supermarket.

167
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,012
So?

168
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:31,350
Hey, man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

169
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:32,893
This is beginning.

170
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,354
We've got one dead guy,
not three.

171
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,564
No motive.

172
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:41,526
Don't even start that big brain of
yours cooking on this, all right?

173
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:44,529
Please, I'd like to be reassigned.

174
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:45,739
What?
What?

175
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:48,867
What, whoa?
What in the hell are you talking about?

176
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:51,411
This can't be my last duty.

177
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,538
It's just gonna go on
and on and on.

178
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:54,748
You're retiring.

179
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:57,084
Six more days
and you're all the way gone.

180
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,461
Won't be the first time
you've left unfinished--

181
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:03,173
Those other oases were taken as close
to conclusion as humanly possible.

182
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,716
And if I may speak freely?

183
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:06,218
We're all friends here.

184
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:09,888
This should not be his first assignment.
Oh, come on, I knew it.

185
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,182
This is not my first assignment,
you dick.

186
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:13,433
It's too soon for him.

187
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,395
Hey, man, I'm right here.
You can say that shit to my face.

188
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:18,230
Captain--
It's too soon for you.

189
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,733
Captain,
if we can just talk in private?

190
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,944
This isn't working.
It's a personal thing.

191
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,654
Maybe--
Just shut up, Mills.

192
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:29,741
Look, I don't have anyone else
to put on this and you know it.

193
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:32,703
This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.

194
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:34,496
Give it to me.

195
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,957
Say what?
Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.

196
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:39,251
Sorry, but see you later.
Have a nice time.

197
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:42,087
Give it to me.
No, I'm putting you on something else.

198
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,133
Go on, Mills.

199
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,884
Just go on.

200
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,850
I'm sorry, old buddy.

201
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:58,520
But it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.

202
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,497
All right, here we go. Quiet down.

203
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:21,418
All right, calm down.
Calm down.

204
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,295
Quiet down.

205
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:25,839
Calm down. Quiet down.

206
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:28,842
Now, here's how it's gonna work.

207
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:32,929
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

208
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:36,433
If those questions do not come in a
calm, sane and orderly fashion...

209
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,809
...I'm on my way out here.

210
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:39,811
Detective?
Detective?

211
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:42,355
Can I have a moment of your time?
No.

212
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:50,197
I will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation...

213
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:51,948
...so don't even bother asking.

214
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,869
<i>I've got shopping tools...</i>

215
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,246
<i>That's 25 Berlin.</i>

216
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:05,087
That looks like him.

217
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,257
<i>Three items for your case number.</i>

218
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:14,262
What you guys got for me?
Nothing yet, boss.

219
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:21,394
Why don't you guys, uh,
go get a coffee, huh?

220
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,356
<i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>

221
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:26,399
<i>We're going to go live downtown...</i>

222
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:29,861
<i>...where defense attorney Eli Gould
was found murdered this morning.</i>

223
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:33,698
<i>District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.</i>

224
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,744
<i>There
could be a conflict of interest--</i>

225
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:42,040
<i>That is ridiculous to the point of being
offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>

226
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:43,875
<i>And any claim that there could be...</i>

227
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,294
<i>...is irresponsible.</i>
<i>Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.</i>

228
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,296
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>It's rumored you're far...</i>

229
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:51,133
<i>...from apprehending a suspect.</i>
<i> I've come from a meeting...</i>

230
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,927
<i>...of law enforcement officials
and they've assured me...</i>

231
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:57,806
<i>...they have their
very best men on this.</i>

232
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:03,145
<i>This will be the very definition
of swift justice.</i>

233
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,753
Pardon me, George.

234
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,719
Somerset.
Come in.

235
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,431
Have you heard the news?
Nope, haven't heard.

236
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:42,392
Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.

237
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,313
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

238
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,441
Wrote the word
"greed" on the floor.

239
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:57,532
Greed?
Yeah, in blood.

240
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:00,076
Mills is heading up
the investigation.

241
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,537
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me?

242
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,624
Could you not do that, please?

243
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,167
Oh, okay.

244
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:10,128
Well, good for him.

245
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:13,632
What in the hell are you gonna do
with yourself out there, Somerset?

246
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,759
Oh, I'll work,
maybe on a farm.

247
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:17,135
Fix my house.

248
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:18,970
Don't you feel it?

249
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,306
Don't you feel that feeling?

250
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:24,434
You're not gonna be a cop anymore.

251
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,645
That's the whole idea.

252
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:29,940
I don't think you're leaving.

253
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:32,651
Hell, you can't leave all this.

254
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,571
Guy's out walking his dog.

255
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:38,448
Gets attacked.

256
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:41,326
His watch is taken,
his wallet.

257
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:44,913
While he's lying there
on the sidewalk, helpless...

258
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:48,375
...his attacker stabs
him in both eyes.

259
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:52,295
This happened just last night
about four blocks from here.

260
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,340
Yeah, I read about it.

261
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:59,135
I don't understand this place any longer.
It's the way it's always been.

262
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:00,512
Maybe you're right.

263
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,013
You do this work.

264
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,850
You were made for it and I
don't think you can deny that.

265
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:08,561
Maybe I'm wrong.

266
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:13,149
Oh, uh, the coroner
sent this down for you.

267
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:17,362
Found them in fat boy's stomach,
mixed in with food.

268
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:21,449
Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.
Set them on the desk, please.

269
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,247
They were, uh...

270
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:28,456
They were fed to him.

271
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:09,766
Oh, Lord.

272
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:19,984
This was found on the wall
behind the refrigerator...

273
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:22,320
...in the obesity murder scene.

274
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:28,118
"Long is the way and hard
that out of hell leads up to light."

275
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:30,120
It's from Milton.

276
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:32,205
<i>Paradise Lost.</i>

277
00:23:32,497 --> 00:23:34,416
All right, I'm confused.

278
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:37,419
It means that this is beginning.

279
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:40,588
This was found
behind the same refrigerator.

280
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,882
Written in grease.

281
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,760
There are seven deadly sins,
captain.

282
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,595
Gluttony.

283
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:51,516
Greed.

284
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:56,980
Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...

285
00:23:58,356 --> 00:23:59,858
...and envy.

286
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,235
Seven.
Hold on.

287
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:04,612
This is not even my desk.

288
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,782
You can expect five more of these.

289
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:10,618
Now, wait a minute.

290
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:14,789
I can't get involved in this.

291
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,084
Somerset.

292
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,961
He wanted it.

293
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:24,257
Damn.
I'm all over it.

294
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:27,886
What's wrong with you?

295
00:24:58,082 --> 00:24:59,667
Where you headed?

296
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:04,589
Far away from here.

297
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:16,392
Thanks, George.
How you doing?

298
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,186
Just a few things to look up.

299
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:20,271
Okay. Sit where you'd like.

300
00:25:21,606 --> 00:25:22,815
How's everybody?

301
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,110
Hi, Smiley.

302
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:28,780
Come on, George,
the cards are getting cold.

303
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:30,281
Duty calls.

304
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,466
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

305
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,009
I'll never understand.

306
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,137
All these books...

307
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,640
...a world of knowledge
at your fingertips.

308
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,392
What do you do?

309
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,310
You play poker all night.

310
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:01,646
Hey, we got culture.

311
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,815
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

312
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,819
All right.

313
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:10,029
How's this for culture?

314
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,480
You know, Smiley...

315
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:52,150
...you're really gonna miss us.

316
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:55,403
I just might.

317
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:54,879
Fucking Dante.

318
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:59,425
Goddamn poetry-writing faggot
piece of shit.

319
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:01,177
Fucker.

320
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,394
Yeah?

321
00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:13,940
Good work, officer.

322
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,907
Thank you, Lord.

323
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:32,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:35,586
Be out of your way in a second.

325
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:49,851
You want your chair?
No. You go ahead.

326
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:51,435
Yeah?

327
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:31,475
Phone.

328
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:33,102
It's a package deal.

329
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:34,312
Comes with the office.

330
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:40,985
Mills.
<i>Honey.</i>

331
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,739
Are you okay, something wrong?
No.

332
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:49,201
You dingleberry, I, uh, told you not
to call me here when I'm working.

333
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,163
Yeah. Why?

334
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,915
Why?

335
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:57,376
Why?
Come on.

336
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:02,340
Okay.

337
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,011
It's my wife.

338
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,554
Sorry?

339
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:11,474
She'd like to speak to you.

340
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,277
Uh, this is Detective Somerset.

341
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:25,363
<i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i>

342
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,199
Well, it's nice to talk to you too.

343
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,203
I appreciate the offer, but--

344
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:38,000
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
Great.

345
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:41,170
Yes, thank you very much.
<i>Thank you. See you later.</i>

346
00:32:41,337 --> 00:32:42,672
Bye.

347
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,175
Hon, what--?

348
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:55,851
Well?

349
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,396
Sorry? Oh, uh.
What?

350
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:01,107
I've been invited to a late supper
at your apartment.

351
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:02,692
I accepted.

352
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:05,236
At my-- How's that?

353
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:06,988
Tonight.

354
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:10,491
<i>Twenty-one-fifty-seven.</i>

355
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:15,538
Hello, men.

356
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:17,873
Hi, loser.
Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,876
This is Tracy.

358
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:24,130
Somerset.
Hello.

359
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:27,800
I'm very happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,927
Except, of course,
your first name.

361
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:32,555
It's William.

362
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:37,018
Hmm, well,
it's a good name, William.

363
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,437
William,
I'd like you to meet David.

364
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:42,148
David, this is William.
Okay, all right, I'm gonna--

365
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,441
I'll be right back.

366
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,735
How are the kids?
Good, they're in the room.

367
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,361
Come on in.

368
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,322
Oh, good dogs.

369
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:53,367
How are you, good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

370
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,121
How are you?

371
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:00,458
How are you?

372
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:02,710
You are?

373
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,297
Smells good.
What?

374
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,882
Uh.
Oh.

375
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:09,675
Yeah.
I mean, thank you.

376
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:14,722
Um, please have a seat, if you like.
Would you like something to drink?

377
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,348
Uh, no. No, thanks.

378
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:19,018
I'll wait.
Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.

379
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:23,522
You'll have to excuse all this mess.
You know, we're still unpacking.

380
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,985
I understand you two
were high school sweethearts.

381
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:29,320
Mm-hm.

382
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,740
Pretty hokey, huh?

383
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,326
You know something?

384
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,704
I knew on our first date that this
was the guy I was gonna marry.

385
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,414
Really?
Mm-hm.

386
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:43,918
He was the funniest
guy I'd ever met.

387
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,298
Really?

388
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,929
Well, it's kind of rare
nowadays, you know.

389
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:58,849
I mean, that level of commitment.

390
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,147
Oh, don't worry.

391
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:08,192
I won't wear it to the dinner table.
No, ha, ha.

392
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,862
I, uh-- You know, no matter
how often I see guns, I just--

393
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:14,990
I can't get used to them.

394
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:16,909
Same here.

395
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:28,879
Why aren't you married, William?

396
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,215
Oh, Trace,
what the hell?

397
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:33,509
I was close once.

398
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:35,302
It just didn't happen.

399
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,763
It surprises me.

400
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,932
It really does.

401
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,393
Well...

402
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:47,857
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

403
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,817
Just ask your husband.

404
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,318
Very true.

405
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,737
Very, very true.

406
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:56,532
So how long have you lived here?

407
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:57,992
Too long.

408
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,289
How are you liking it?

409
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:09,587
You know, takes time,
settle in.

410
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,964
It'll be good.

411
00:36:12,131 --> 00:36:14,258
Well, you get numb after awhile.

412
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:17,094
There are things to any city.

413
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,935
Subway.

414
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:28,063
It will go away in a minute.
It's nothing.

415
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,902
Real estate guy.

416
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,403
Fucking piece of...

417
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,363
Sorry, honey.
He's...

418
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,866
He shows us the place
a few times.

419
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,910
I think he's good.
He's efficient.

420
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,953
Tracy really likes him.

421
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,458
Then I start wondering why will he only
bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?

422
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,335
We found out the first night.

423
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:54,757
The soothing, relaxing,
vibrating home, huh?

424
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,808
I'm sorry.

425
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:13,442
Yeah, all right, laugh it up.

426
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,530
I don't know why you're laughing.

427
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,536
All right, already.

428
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,792
The guy would've had to get in...

429
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,503
...before the office was closed
and security tightened.

430
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,505
Now, Gould would've
been working late.

431
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:37,716
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

432
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:38,926
Infamous, really.

433
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:41,303
Now listen, body was found
on Tuesday morning.

434
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,641
The office was closed on Monday, which
means the guy could've gotten in Friday...

435
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:50,062
...laid low till the cleaning crew left then
had his way with Gould all day Saturday...

436
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,773
...Sunday, maybe even Monday.

437
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,692
Hey, look at this.

438
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,111
Gould was bound,
right arm almost free.

439
00:37:57,278 --> 00:37:58,779
He was handed a
butcher's knife.

440
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,574
Check out the scale.

441
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:03,993
A pound of flesh?

442
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,120
Yeah.

443
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,717
<i>Merchant of Venice.</i>
Didn't see it.

444
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,053
"This task done and
he would go free."

445
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,390
I'm telling you that chair
was soaked through with sweat.

446
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,309
Of course.

447
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:31,770
The killer would've wanted Gould
to take his time...

448
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:35,441
...to sit and decide
which out to make first.

449
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,109
Imagine it.

450
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,570
There's a gun in your face.

451
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,656
Which part of your body
is expendable?

452
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:44,658
What about the love handle?

453
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,578
Cut along the side of
his own stomach.

454
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,748
All right, let's take a
fresh look at these.

455
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,208
Even though the corpse is there,
look through it.

456
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,085
Edit out the initial shock.

457
00:38:55,252 --> 00:39:00,674
Trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

458
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:03,385
...until it's an
exhausted possibility.

459
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,346
Just gonna get another beer.
Beer?

460
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,723
Uh, wine, please.

461
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:17,775
He's preaching.

462
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,735
He's punishing.

463
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,865
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

464
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,993
There were seven cardinal virtues
and seven deadly sins...

465
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,453
...used as teaching tools.

466
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,122
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and--

467
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:33,791
What's this? Uh, Dante.

468
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,168
You read them?
Yeah.

469
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:39,421
Well, parts.
Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory?

470
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:41,965
Dante and his buddy,
they're climbing up the hill...

471
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,301
...they're checking out
all the sinners, yeah?

472
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:47,763
Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.
Yeah, yeah, right.

473
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,183
But there, pride comes first,
not gluttony.

474
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,354
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider
that the books were the killer's inspiration.

475
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:58,982
The sermons
were about atonement for sin.

476
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,276
These murders are
like forced attrition.

477
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,029
Forced what?
Attrition.

478
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,990
It's when you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.

479
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,202
Oh, like because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.

480
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:11,829
Mm-hm.

481
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,583
No fingerprints.
Nope.

482
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,003
Totally unrelated victims.
Yup.

483
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,631
And no witnesses of any kind.

484
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,466
Which I don't get.

485
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,886
Because the fucker
had to get back out.

486
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:32,975
Well, in any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

487
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:37,020
The first thing they teach women in
rape prevention is never cry for help.

488
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,356
Always yell "Fire."

489
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:40,816
Nobody answers to "Help."

490
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,901
You holler "fire,"
they come running.

491
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,736
That's fucked up.

492
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:48,198
He must've left another
puzzle piece.

493
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:50,909
You know what?

494
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:54,371
Thank you for talking this
out, but I gotta sleep.

495
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:58,167
Walk the dogs.
This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.

496
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,044
I'm still leaving at the end of the week.
Oh, shit.

497
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,838
No, wait, wait.

498
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,842
Gould's wife. She was
out of town at the time.

499
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:10,220
So this means she saw something.
What if it's a threat?

500
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:13,056
Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

501
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:24,860
What if it isn't
something she has seen?

502
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:29,114
But something she's supposed to see,
but hasn't been given a chance?

503
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:30,991
Yeah, okay. What?

504
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,118
I don't know.

505
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:36,997
But that's the one thing.

506
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,669
Sign us in.

507
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:25,921
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

508
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,423
treat me like a prisoner.

509
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,760
Why do you have a phone if I can't
make long distance phone calls?

510
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,011
Mrs. Gould?

511
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,596
Don't treat people like this.

512
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:42,104
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry.
I truly am.

513
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,606
I don't understand.

514
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:49,861
Okay, I need you to look at
each photo very carefully.

515
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:54,992
Look and see if there's anything
strange or out of place.

516
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,159
Um, anything at all.

517
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,246
I don't see anything.
You're sure?

518
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,915
Please, I just--
I can't do this right now.

519
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,709
Okay.

520
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,752
It's got to be now.

521
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:08,213
There may be something
we haven't seen.

522
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:18,473
Wait.

523
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,892
What?
Here.

524
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:27,858
This painting, it's upside down.

525
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,242
You sure your men didn't move this?
No,no.

526
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:40,120
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

527
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:44,666
Nothing.

528
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:48,211
There's gotta be something.

529
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:01,391
Moved the screws to rehang it.
Yep.

530
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:07,439
What the fuck is that?

531
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,275
Switchblade.

532
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,118
Goddamn it.

533
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:26,083
There must be something.

534
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:33,382
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

535
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:44,059
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

536
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:47,145
See this? This is us.

537
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:48,814
Yeah.

538
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,607
Just wait a minute.

539
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,153
Now Somerset's climbing
on the furniture.

540
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,280
Just wait a minute.

541
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:03,995
You're kidding me.

542
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:06,623
Call the Print Lab.

543
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:13,463
Oh, man.

544
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:20,971
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?

545
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,099
No.

546
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,979
I can tell you, guys, just by
looking at the swirl pattern...

547
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,773
...they're not the
victim's fingerprints.

548
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:46,496
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.

549
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:48,915
It doesn't fit.

550
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,461
He doesn't wants us to help him stop.
Who knows?

551
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:56,631
So many freaks out there doing their
little evil deeds they don't wanna do.

552
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:59,885
"The voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it.

553
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:01,845
Jodie Foster told me to do it."

554
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:05,599
You know, um, I've seen this baby take
as long as three days to make a match...

555
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:09,269
...so maybe you guys wanna cross
your fingers somewhere else.

556
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:15,358
You meant what you said to
Mrs. Gould, didn't you?

557
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:18,737
About catching this guy.
Yeah.

558
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:20,030
Hmm.

559
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:23,784
Wish I still thought the way you do.

560
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,705
Why don't you tell me what the hell
it is you think we're doing then.

561
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,333
Picking up the pieces.

562
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:37,339
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples.

563
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,466
Writing everything down.

564
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:42,302
Noting the time things happened.

565
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:46,556
That's all?
That's all.

566
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:50,769
Putting everything into neat
little piles and filing it away.

567
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,898
On the off chance it will ever
be needed in the courtroom.

568
00:46:57,192 --> 00:47:00,362
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island.

569
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:04,074
Saving them in case we get rescued.

570
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,578
Bullshit.

571
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:14,751
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

572
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:20,006
So many corpses roll
away unrevenged.

573
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:26,179
Don't try to tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

574
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:28,598
I saw you.

575
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,268
We're getting somewhere.

576
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,159
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

577
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,620
You've got a winner.

578
00:47:56,418 --> 00:48:00,088
This guy goes by the name of Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

579
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,924
His prints were found
at the scene by Homicide.

580
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:06,553
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

581
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,890
His parents gave him a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

582
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:12,726
But somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

583
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,770
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

584
00:48:15,937 --> 00:48:19,608
Spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor.

585
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,235
But his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.

586
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:24,988
His lawyer, by the way,
is the recently deceased Eli Gould.

587
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:26,740
Greed murder victim.
Yes, sir.

588
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:29,659
We're gonna finish this thing
up today, ladies and germs.

589
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:33,830
Victor's been out of circulation a while,
but there's still a residence in his name.

590
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:35,707
You're not buying all this,
are you?

591
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:39,836
Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?
You tell me.

592
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:42,505
Our killer seems to
have more purpose.

593
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:12,827
You ever take a bullet?

594
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,665
Never in my 34 years,
knock wood.

595
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:22,170
I've only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it.

596
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:23,672
Never pulled the trigger.

597
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,799
Not once.

598
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,050
You?

599
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:33,390
Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,
but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.

600
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:35,600
Really?
It was my first one of these.

601
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,978
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:49:38,144 --> 00:49:41,231
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie then.

603
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:44,693
Anyway, we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and, uh...

604
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:47,237
...the fucker just
opened fire on us.

605
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,197
One cop got hit in the arm.

606
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:53,451
Christ, what was his name?

607
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,788
Spun him like a top.

608
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:59,040
You know,
I mean, more like slow motion.

609
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,585
I remember...

610
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:05,088
...riding in that ambulance.

611
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,216
Well, he died right there.

612
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:10,427
Right there.

613
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,929
Christ, what was his fucking name?

614
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:28,987
All rise.
Let's do it. Let's do it.

615
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:32,407
Go, go, go. Move.

616
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,619
Okay.

617
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:57,307
Get up there.

618
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:34,094
SWAT goes before dicks.

619
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,720
Hey.

620
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:39,099
They love this.

621
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:41,434
Police.

622
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:43,812
Clear.

623
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,524
Clear.
Clear.

624
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:48,900
Clear.

625
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:03,706
Clear.

626
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:13,466
Morning, sweetheart.

627
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:15,885
Get up now, motherfucker.

628
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:17,345
Now!

629
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:28,439
Get up, you sack of shit.

630
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:36,739
Oh, fuck me.

631
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:41,077
Dicks, you'll wanna
come take a look at this.

632
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,498
Dicks!

633
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,213
Oof.

634
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,423
Jesus.

635
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:55,633
Victor?
What the hell?

636
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,051
Yeah, it's just Victor.

637
00:52:57,218 --> 00:52:59,179
Call an ambulance.
What is this?

638
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:01,598
Hearse more like it.
Also Forensics.

639
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:03,975
California, get your people out.
Go on now.

640
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,602
No one touches anything.

641
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:07,937
It's some frigging wax
sculpture or something.

642
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,276
"Sloth."

643
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:24,078
Oh, man.

644
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:26,039
Goddamn.

645
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:28,917
Those pictures
were dated three days ago.

646
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:39,093
This must be the first one. Look.

647
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:42,430
It's dated exactly one
year ago today.

648
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:50,480
I got a hair sample, I got a stool
sample, I got piss, I got fingernails.

649
00:53:52,523 --> 00:53:56,569
He's laughing at us.
You got what you deserved.

650
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,074
He's alive, he's alive!

651
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,034
That cocksucker's alive!
Guns down.

652
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:06,162
Still breathing!
Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!

653
00:54:14,003 --> 00:54:15,088
Corning through.

654
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:26,432
He's playing games.
No shit.

655
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:30,144
Look, we have to divorce ourselves
from emotion here.

656
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:31,354
Oh.

657
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:33,523
No matter how hard it is,
we have to remain focused.

658
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,858
Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.
How's that?

659
00:54:36,025 --> 00:54:38,820
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I can hear you.

660
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:40,613
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

661
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,366
Closed crime scene, get out.
I got a right to be here.

662
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:44,909
UPI photographer.
Get out.

663
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:47,829
Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.
Get out of here.

664
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:49,914
Get out. Jesus.
Fucking jerk. Fuck you.

665
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:51,708
I got your picture, man.
Oh, yeah?

666
00:54:51,874 --> 00:54:53,334
I got your picture.
Yeah?

667
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:56,546
Detective Mills,
M-I-L-L-S, fuck off.

668
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:59,007
I'm surprised you can spell.
Fuck you.

669
00:54:59,757 --> 00:55:02,093
How do they get here
so fucking quick?

670
00:55:02,552 --> 00:55:04,637
They pay police for
the information.

671
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:05,847
And they pay well.

672
00:55:06,723 --> 00:55:08,683
Hey, man, I'm sorry, I...

673
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,518
Those, ugh...

674
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,396
You know, they piss me off.
It's okay.

675
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:16,065
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

676
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:25,074
A year of
immobility seems about right...

677
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:28,161
...judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine.

678
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:31,831
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

679
00:55:31,998 --> 00:55:33,249
Even an antibiotic...

680
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:37,628
...which must've been administered
to keep the bed sores from infecting.

681
00:55:37,795 --> 00:55:41,758
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

682
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:44,594
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

683
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,638
...he chewed off
his own tongue long ago.

684
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,225
Uh, Doc.

685
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:55,271
ls there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

686
00:55:55,772 --> 00:56:01,069
Detective, he'd die of shock right now if
you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.

687
00:56:01,235 --> 00:56:04,781
He's experienced about as much pain
and suffering as anyone I've encountered.

688
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:06,783
Give or take.

689
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:10,244
And he still has hell
to look forward to.

690
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,537
Good night.

691
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:15,541
<i>Tonight we bring you
the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>

692
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:18,711
<i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on
piano, Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...</i>

693
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:23,424
<i>...Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,
and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.</i>

694
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:26,135
Yeah?
<i>Hello, William?</i>

695
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:30,014
<i>It's Tracy.</i>
Tracy?

696
00:56:30,181 --> 00:56:34,519
Is everything all right?
<i>Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>

697
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:36,354
Where's David?
<i>He's just, uh--</i>

698
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,898
<i>He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.</i>

699
00:56:39,065 --> 00:56:41,984
<i>Um, I'm sorry to
call you like this.</i>

700
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:44,028
Oh, it's all right. Um...

701
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:46,030
What can I do for you, Tracy?

702
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,158
I, uh...

703
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:51,661
Um, heh.

704
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,704
I need someone to talk to.

705
00:56:53,871 --> 00:56:57,333
Do you think
you could meet me somewhere...

706
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,001
...maybe tomorrow morning?

707
00:57:00,169 --> 00:57:02,338
I don't understand.

708
00:57:02,964 --> 00:57:06,050
<i>I feel stupid calling, but, uh...</i>

709
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:10,513
...you're the only person
that I know here.

710
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,014
There's no one else.

711
00:57:12,598 --> 00:57:16,644
<i>If you can, just, uh,
give me a call, okay?</i>

712
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:18,813
<i>I have to go now.</i>

713
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:21,691
<i>Well, good night.
Good night.</i>

714
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:34,829
I mean, you know this city so well.

715
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:38,958
You've been here so long.

716
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:42,211
It can be a hard place.

717
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:45,047
I don't know why I
asked you to come.

718
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:49,177
Why don't you talk to him about it?

719
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:51,012
Tell him how you feel.

720
00:57:52,221 --> 00:57:55,057
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.

721
00:57:55,224 --> 00:57:57,310
Especially now.

722
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:01,063
I'll get used to things.

723
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,191
You know? I think I just...

724
00:58:03,357 --> 00:58:07,653
I wanted to talk to someone who's
lived here for a long time and...

725
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:14,202
I mean, upstate, you know, it's a
completely different environment.

726
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:19,373
Did David tell you
that I teach fifth grade?

727
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,209
Well, I did.

728
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:25,004
Uh, he mentioned it.

729
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:31,594
I've been going around,
you know, looking at schools.

730
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:37,767
But the conditions
here are horrible.

731
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,102
What about private schools?

732
00:58:43,272 --> 00:58:45,233
I don't know.

733
00:58:46,275 --> 00:58:49,445
Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you, Tracy.

734
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:54,242
David and I are gonna have a baby.

735
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:00,706
Oh, Tracy, I...

736
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:03,709
I don't think I'm the, heh...

737
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:06,170
I'm the one to talk to about this.

738
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:08,589
I hate this city.

739
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:14,929
I had a relationship once.

740
00:59:15,304 --> 00:59:17,306
It was very much like a marriage.

741
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:22,311
We got pregnant.

742
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:25,106
This was a long time ago.

743
00:59:31,028 --> 00:59:34,323
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

744
00:59:36,158 --> 00:59:40,871
Just another day like any other, except it
was the first day after I knew about...

745
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:43,082
...the pregnancy.

746
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:49,338
And I felt this fear for
the first time ever.

747
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:55,761
I remember thinking how can I bring
a child into a world like this?

748
00:59:55,928 --> 01:00:00,182
How can--? How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

749
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,109
I told her I didn't
want to have it.

750
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:13,904
And over the next few weeks...

751
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:17,325
...I wore her down.

752
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:21,954
I wanna have children.

753
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,711
I can tell you now that...

754
01:00:29,253 --> 01:00:31,380
I'm-- I know, I mean...

755
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:37,511
I'm positive
that I made the right decision.

756
01:00:37,678 --> 01:00:39,972
But there's not a
day that passes...

757
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:44,602
...that I don't wish
that I had made a different choice.

758
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,316
If you don't keep...

759
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:55,237
The baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

760
01:00:57,073 --> 01:00:59,492
...don't ever tell him
that you were pregnant.

761
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:04,622
But if you choose to
have this baby...

762
01:01:05,122 --> 01:01:08,668
...you spoil that kid
every chance you get.

763
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:20,137
That's about all the advice
I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:01:27,186 --> 01:01:28,771
I got to go.

765
01:01:28,938 --> 01:01:30,606
William.

766
01:01:37,363 --> 01:01:38,531
Thank you.

767
01:01:52,378 --> 01:01:56,382
Victor's landlord said there was
an envelope of cash in the office mailbox...

768
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:58,634
...the first of every month.

769
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:04,557
Quote:

770
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:08,185
"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant in Apartment 306.

771
01:02:08,352 --> 01:02:10,980
And nobody ever complained about him.
Heh.

772
01:02:11,147 --> 01:02:13,733
He's the best tenant I've
ever had," end quote.

773
01:02:13,899 --> 01:02:15,818
Yeah, a landlord's dream.

774
01:02:15,985 --> 01:02:17,653
A paralyzed tenant
with no tongue.

775
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,447
Who pays the rent on time.

776
01:02:20,614 --> 01:02:23,492
I'm sick of all this waiting.
This is the job.

777
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:26,287
Why aren't we out there, huh?

778
01:02:26,454 --> 01:02:31,667
Why do we gotta sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic does it again?

779
01:02:31,834 --> 01:02:34,712
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.
Don't make that mistake.

780
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:37,506
Come on, he's insane.
Look.

781
01:02:37,673 --> 01:02:41,635
Right now he's probably dancing
around in his grandma's panties.

782
01:02:41,802 --> 01:02:44,764
Yeah, rubbing himself in
peanut butter. Ooh.

783
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:48,058
How's that?
I don't think so.

784
01:02:48,934 --> 01:02:51,562
His luck will run out.

785
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:54,398
Not depending on luck.

786
01:02:57,276 --> 01:03:01,113
We walked into that apartment exactly
one year after he tied Victor to the bed.

787
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,199
One year to the day.

788
01:03:03,365 --> 01:03:05,659
He wanted us to.
Don't know that for sure.

789
01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:07,578
Oh, yes, we do.

790
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,289
This note he left.

791
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:12,166
His first words to us.

792
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:20,007
Fuck him. So what?

793
01:03:20,174 --> 01:03:22,051
He's right, so far.

794
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:26,722
Imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year.

795
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:30,726
To sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints.

796
01:03:30,893 --> 01:03:33,687
To insert tubes into his genitals.

797
01:03:34,104 --> 01:03:38,901
This guy is methodical, exacting,
and worst of all, patient.

798
01:03:39,276 --> 01:03:41,028
He's a nut bag.

799
01:03:41,195 --> 01:03:45,449
And just because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

800
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:53,123
How much money you got?
I got like 50. 50 bucks.

801
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,252
I propose a field trip. Come on.

802
01:03:59,588 --> 01:04:00,589
We'll make a list.

803
01:04:00,756 --> 01:04:03,592
At the top we'll put <i>Purgatory,
Canterbury Tales.</i>

804
01:04:03,759 --> 01:04:06,387
Anything relating
to the seven deadly sins.

805
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:08,013
Ask yourself--
Hey, wait, wait.

806
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,933
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

807
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,143
What are his interests now?

808
01:04:13,644 --> 01:04:15,437
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

809
01:04:15,604 --> 01:04:17,314
Where are we going?
Library.

810
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,497
Coupons, coupons, free coupons.

811
01:04:33,664 --> 01:04:36,083
Discount-- Discount coupons.

812
01:04:37,376 --> 01:04:41,630
They must've had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

813
01:04:41,797 --> 01:04:46,468
Could you at least sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking we're dating.

814
01:04:46,635 --> 01:04:48,637
Give me your money.

815
01:04:49,638 --> 01:04:53,934
I'm giving you this, but for some reason,
I don't think I know what we're doing.

816
01:04:56,478 --> 01:04:57,980
Fuck.

817
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:01,025
Hey, Somerset, how you doing?
Okay.

818
01:05:01,191 --> 01:05:04,653
Didn't figure this was a ménage á trois.
It's not a problem.

819
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,488
Sit down.

820
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:14,330
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

821
01:05:14,663 --> 01:05:16,999
So I figure we're just
fair and square.

822
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:19,376
It's a deal.
All right.

823
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,090
About an hour.

824
01:05:26,842 --> 01:05:29,136
Yeah, help yourself.

825
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:33,432
Well, that was money well spent.

826
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,684
Yeah.

827
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,652
All right.

828
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:48,030
By telling you this, I'm trusting
you more than I trust most people.

829
01:05:48,197 --> 01:05:50,991
Well, good,
because I'm ready to punch you.

830
01:05:52,743 --> 01:05:56,914
It's probably nothing, but even if
it is, it's no skin off our teeth.

831
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,503
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

832
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:05,631
Who, stinky man?

833
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:10,594
See, for years the FBI's been hooked
into the library system, keeping records.

834
01:06:10,761 --> 01:06:15,099
Mm-hm. Assessing fines?
No, monitoring reading habits.

835
01:06:15,265 --> 01:06:16,600
Look.
What?

836
01:06:16,767 --> 01:06:18,644
Certain books are flagged.

837
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:23,399
Books on, say, nuclear weapons
and, well, <i>Mein Kampf.</i>

838
01:06:23,565 --> 01:06:25,442
Anyone who checks out
a flagged book...

839
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:28,570
...has his library records fed
into the FBI's computers then on.

840
01:06:28,737 --> 01:06:30,739
Wait, wait, wait,
how is this legal?

841
01:06:30,906 --> 01:06:33,742
Oh, legal, illegal.
These terms don't apply.

842
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:35,077
Oh.
You--

843
01:06:35,244 --> 01:06:39,415
You can't use the information directly.
It's just a useful guide.

844
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:42,251
It might sound silly,
but you can't get a library card...

845
01:06:42,418 --> 01:06:44,420
...without, uh, an ID
and a current phone bill, see?

846
01:06:48,257 --> 01:06:50,926
So they run a list.
Precisely.

847
01:06:51,093 --> 01:06:54,471
If you wanna know who's reading
<i>Purgatory and Paradise Lost...</i>

848
01:06:54,638 --> 01:06:59,643
...and <i>Helter Skelter,</i>
the FBI's computers will tell us.

849
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,770
It could give us a name.
It could.

850
01:07:01,937 --> 01:07:05,774
Could get a name of some college kid
writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.

851
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,777
At least you're out of the office.

852
01:07:08,944 --> 01:07:10,654
Get a haircut.

853
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:13,532
How do you know all this?
I don't.

854
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:16,827
Neither do you.
Exactly.

855
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:28,881
<i>"The Divine Comedy.
History of Catholicism."</i>

856
01:07:29,048 --> 01:07:31,216
<i>There's a book called
Murderers and Madmen.</i>

857
01:07:31,383 --> 01:07:35,179
<i>"Modern Homicide Investigation,
In Cold Blood.</i>

858
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:37,347
<i>Of Human Bondage."
Bondage?</i>

859
01:07:37,514 --> 01:07:39,808
Not what you think.
Okay.

860
01:07:39,975 --> 01:07:42,144
<i>"The Marquis de Sade."</i>

861
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:44,146
It's the Marquis de Sade.
Whatever.

862
01:07:44,313 --> 01:07:46,690
<i>"The Writings of Saint
Thomas Aqua--" Something.</i>

863
01:07:46,857 --> 01:07:49,109
Saint Thomas Aquinas.
There it is.

864
01:07:49,276 --> 01:07:52,112
He wrote about the
seven deadly sins.

865
01:07:52,279 --> 01:07:54,865
Is that it?
Yeah.

866
01:07:55,491 --> 01:07:58,327
Let's try it.
Jonathan Doe?

867
01:07:58,494 --> 01:07:59,578
Whatever.

868
01:07:59,745 --> 01:08:01,330
We're sure about that name?

869
01:08:01,497 --> 01:08:02,498
Yeah.

870
01:08:02,664 --> 01:08:05,209
You saw it, John Doe.

871
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:07,795
You wanna go back, I'll go back.

872
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:10,214
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

873
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:12,508
This is crazy.

874
01:08:12,674 --> 01:08:15,469
Ah, we'll just talk to him.
Uh-huh.

875
01:08:15,636 --> 01:08:19,056
"Excuse me, sir. Are you by
any chance a serial killer?"

876
01:08:20,432 --> 01:08:22,059
Okay.

877
01:08:22,226 --> 01:08:24,103
You do the talking.

878
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:27,064
Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
No.

879
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:29,483
You been talking
to my wife?

880
01:08:32,402 --> 01:08:34,655
This is retarded.

881
01:08:34,822 --> 01:08:36,615
<i>Charlie's Fucking Angels.</i>

882
01:08:37,366 --> 01:08:39,785
A name off a computer.

883
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:44,706
Mills.

884
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:53,632
Fuck.

885
01:08:55,217 --> 01:08:57,553
You hit?
No.

886
01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:02,641
He's going down, he's going down!

887
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,159
Fifth floor.

888
01:09:20,325 --> 01:09:21,785
Mills.

889
01:09:23,412 --> 01:09:25,414
Mommy?

890
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:27,416
Mommy?

891
01:09:40,429 --> 01:09:42,723
Police. ls there a back way out?

892
01:09:43,223 --> 01:09:44,266
Lock your door.

893
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:49,980
What the hell is going on, man?
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

894
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,882
Get down.
Aah!

895
01:10:17,049 --> 01:10:18,133
Hey.

896
01:10:18,675 --> 01:10:20,010
Get the fuck down.

897
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:50,207
Aah!

898
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:55,254
Shit.

899
01:10:56,672 --> 01:10:59,174
Get the fuck out of there.

900
01:11:11,019 --> 01:11:14,690
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

901
01:11:57,107 --> 01:11:58,317
Goddamn it.

902
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:10,203
Fuck.

903
01:13:01,046 --> 01:13:03,673
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

904
01:14:04,192 --> 01:14:06,027
Mills?

905
01:14:07,028 --> 01:14:08,697
No.

906
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:30,427
Mills.

907
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:35,891
Mills, you okay?
I'm all right.

908
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:39,728
I'm all right.

909
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:45,442
Where are you going?
I'm going in.

910
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:48,028
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

911
01:14:48,361 --> 01:14:50,030
Wait.
What are you talking about?

912
01:14:50,197 --> 01:14:51,573
He shot at us.
You can't.

913
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,533
The hell we can't.
We need a warrant.

914
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,410
We got probable cause. Come on.

915
01:14:55,577 --> 01:14:56,745
Think about it, think.

916
01:14:56,912 --> 01:14:58,413
How did we get here?
Huh?

917
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:01,791
I can't tell anyone this, I can't tell anyone.
Oh, come on, out of the way.

918
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:03,835
We have no reason to be here.

919
01:15:04,002 --> 01:15:05,462
Will you listen to me?
Get off.

920
01:15:05,629 --> 01:15:07,797
Listen to me, listen.
Get the fuck off me.

921
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:09,591
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

922
01:15:09,758 --> 01:15:12,260
But would you
just pay attention a minute?

923
01:15:12,427 --> 01:15:15,722
If we leave a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

924
01:15:15,889 --> 01:15:18,558
The fucking guy will walk.
Now, is that what you want?

925
01:15:18,725 --> 01:15:21,520
By the time we clear a warrant,
someone else-- No, fuck that.

926
01:15:21,686 --> 01:15:26,024
We need a reason to knock on this door.
No,no.

927
01:15:26,525 --> 01:15:28,318
Think about it.

928
01:15:29,569 --> 01:15:31,154
Okay?

929
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,283
Okay, man. Okay.

930
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,994
You're right.
I'm all fucked up.

931
01:15:38,161 --> 01:15:40,121
When you're right, you're right.

932
01:15:48,004 --> 01:15:52,217
Well, no point in arguing anymore.

933
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:54,803
Unless you can fix that.

934
01:15:56,721 --> 01:15:59,849
You stupid son of a...

935
01:16:07,774 --> 01:16:09,734
How much money we got left?

936
01:16:10,527 --> 01:16:14,239
So, yeah, like, I noticed
this guy going out a lot.

937
01:16:14,406 --> 01:16:17,325
When the murders was
happening, so I, um...

938
01:16:17,492 --> 01:16:19,828
So you called Detective
Somerset, right?

939
01:16:19,995 --> 01:16:24,124
Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,
because this guy was creepy and shit.

940
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:27,002
And one of the murders,
it happened right over there.

941
01:16:27,168 --> 01:16:29,796
Okay. I told you the rest. You got it?
Called the cops.

942
01:16:29,963 --> 01:16:31,006
Good?
Got your story.

943
01:16:31,172 --> 01:16:32,882
Have her sign. You gotta sign.
Okay.

944
01:16:33,049 --> 01:16:35,302
Okay?
Good, good, good.

945
01:16:35,468 --> 01:16:38,179
All right.
You did good.

946
01:16:38,346 --> 01:16:40,640
I did what you said.
Here you go.

947
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:43,351
You get something to eat, all right?
You eat.

948
01:16:46,438 --> 01:16:48,565
Everybody, stay outside.

949
01:17:49,876 --> 01:17:51,461
Victor.

950
01:20:04,385 --> 01:20:06,721
Somerset!

951
01:20:07,847 --> 01:20:11,226
Somerset!
Yeah?

952
01:20:14,771 --> 01:20:17,315
What?
We had him.

953
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:19,275
What are you talking about?

954
01:20:19,442 --> 01:20:22,904
The fucking photographer
in the fucking stairs.

955
01:20:27,408 --> 01:20:29,869
We had him and we let him go.

956
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:37,794
You're sure this is him?

957
01:20:37,961 --> 01:20:39,254
Yup, good, good.
Yup.

958
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,089
Yeah, good, get it out.
All right.

959
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:44,425
Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs,
no appointment books, no addresses.

960
01:20:44,592 --> 01:20:46,427
This is the best, this receipt.
Keep looking.

961
01:20:46,594 --> 01:20:48,555
Let me show you something.
This was under the bed.

962
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:50,682
Uh, his only source of funds.

963
01:20:50,849 --> 01:20:53,184
No kidding, we got his money.
Fucking A, I like it.

964
01:20:53,351 --> 01:20:54,435
One thing.
Yes?

965
01:20:54,602 --> 01:20:57,564
You're probably not gonna believe this.
We haven't found a fingerprint yet.

966
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:01,734
Um, not a single one.
You're right, I don't. Keep looking.

967
01:21:06,531 --> 01:21:07,991
We could use some
more men here.

968
01:21:08,157 --> 01:21:11,578
Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.
What are you getting with all this?

969
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:13,746
There are 2000 notebooks
on these shelves.

970
01:21:13,913 --> 01:21:16,791
And each notebook contains
about 250 pages.

971
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:19,586
Forget it.
Anything about the killings?

972
01:21:20,003 --> 01:21:24,215
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
and what a gross stage we dance on.

973
01:21:24,382 --> 01:21:28,303
What fun we have dancing and
fucking. Not a care in the world.

974
01:21:28,469 --> 01:21:30,138
Not knowing that
we are nothing.

975
01:21:30,305 --> 01:21:32,557
We are not what was intended."

976
01:21:32,724 --> 01:21:35,143
No, wait, there's a lot more.

977
01:21:36,144 --> 01:21:39,480
"On the subway today, a man came up
to me to start a conversation.

978
01:21:40,023 --> 01:21:44,152
He made small talk, a lonely man,
talking about the weather and things.

979
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:46,446
I tried to be pleasant
and accommodating.

980
01:21:46,613 --> 01:21:49,407
But my head began to hurt
from his banality.

981
01:21:49,574 --> 01:21:54,537
I almost didn't notice it had happened,
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

982
01:21:54,829 --> 01:21:59,626
He was not pleased.
And I couldn't stop laughing."

983
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,961
No dates.

984
01:22:02,128 --> 01:22:05,465
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

985
01:22:06,382 --> 01:22:09,469
Just his mind poured
out on paper.

986
01:22:09,636 --> 01:22:11,012
Looks like a life's work.

987
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:14,557
If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour
shifts, it'd still take two months.

988
01:22:14,724 --> 01:22:16,476
I know, I know, I know.

989
01:22:20,563 --> 01:22:21,814
Where's that phone?

990
01:22:25,193 --> 01:22:26,778
Phone? Phone?

991
01:22:26,945 --> 01:22:28,029
Phone?

992
01:22:30,949 --> 01:22:32,951
People, quiet.

993
01:22:47,882 --> 01:22:50,718
Hello?
<i>I admire you.</i>

994
01:22:51,552 --> 01:22:55,139
<i>I don't know how you found me,
but imagine my surprise.</i>

995
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:59,018
<i>I respect you law enforcement
agents more every day.</i>

996
01:22:59,185 --> 01:23:02,230
Well, I appreciate that,
John.

997
01:23:02,397 --> 01:23:04,107
I tell you--
<i>No, listen, all right?</i>

998
01:23:04,273 --> 01:23:08,361
<i>I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's little setback.</i>

999
01:23:08,528 --> 01:23:10,947
<i>I just had to call and
express my admiration.</i>

1000
01:23:11,114 --> 01:23:13,950
<i>Sorry I had to hurt
one of you...</i>

1001
01:23:14,117 --> 01:23:16,744
<i>...but I didn't really
have a choice, did I?</i>

1002
01:23:16,911 --> 01:23:18,621
<i>You will accept
my apology, won't you?</i>

1003
01:23:18,788 --> 01:23:21,207
<i>I feel like saying more, but I
don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>

1004
01:23:26,129 --> 01:23:29,007
<i>--adjusting my
schedule after today's little setback.</i>

1005
01:23:29,173 --> 01:23:30,508
Got it.

1006
01:23:34,929 --> 01:23:36,764
All right, everybody,
back to work.

1007
01:23:38,766 --> 01:23:40,184
You were right.
Hmm?

1008
01:23:40,351 --> 01:23:43,938
Ugh, he's preaching.
Yeah.

1009
01:23:44,564 --> 01:23:46,566
These murders are
his sermons to us.

1010
01:23:47,025 --> 01:23:50,278
Look, we know him,
we know him, we know him.

1011
01:23:53,072 --> 01:23:54,824
Who's the blonde?

1012
01:23:58,828 --> 01:24:00,455
Looks like a pro.

1013
01:24:00,621 --> 01:24:02,040
Maybe.

1014
01:24:02,206 --> 01:24:04,542
She caught John Doe's eye.

1015
01:24:09,797 --> 01:24:12,341
Yeah, he came and
collected it last night.

1016
01:24:12,508 --> 01:24:14,010
Last night?
Yeah.

1017
01:24:14,177 --> 01:24:15,636
This man?
Yeah, John Doe.

1018
01:24:15,803 --> 01:24:18,014
It's an easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1019
01:24:18,181 --> 01:24:21,809
What was this job you did for him?
I've got a picture of it. Hang on.

1020
01:24:21,976 --> 01:24:24,145
One sweet piece, actually.

1021
01:24:24,312 --> 01:24:27,648
I thought he was one of them performance
artists, that's what I thought.

1022
01:24:27,815 --> 01:24:33,571
You know, the sort of guy that pisses in
a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it.

1023
01:24:33,738 --> 01:24:36,115
Performance art.
Hmm.

1024
01:24:39,035 --> 01:24:41,204
I think I undercharged
him, actually.

1025
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,622
You made this for him?

1026
01:24:42,789 --> 01:24:45,500
Yeah, I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?

1027
01:24:51,422 --> 01:24:53,216
They found the blonde.

1028
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:57,512
The picture.

1029
01:24:57,678 --> 01:24:58,888
The picture.

1030
01:25:00,515 --> 01:25:01,933
Fucking pigs.

1031
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,854
We need you to move, pal.
I'll come out, but you guys--

1032
01:25:07,021 --> 01:25:10,358
Get the fuck out of the booth.
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1033
01:25:10,525 --> 01:25:12,735
Okay?
I'm not fucking with you.

1034
01:25:12,902 --> 01:25:14,654
Come on, this way.

1035
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:23,162
Can you do something
about this music?

1036
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:25,957
Yeah, we're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.

1037
01:25:38,678 --> 01:25:40,388
You from Homicide?
You--

1038
01:25:40,555 --> 01:25:42,515
You better see this.
Yeah. All right.

1039
01:25:44,267 --> 01:25:46,769
Hey, easy. Got him?

1040
01:25:48,896 --> 01:25:51,232
Get this thing off of me.

1041
01:25:51,607 --> 01:25:53,442
Oh, God, get this thing off of me!

1042
01:25:54,068 --> 01:25:55,653
Get this thing off of me!

1043
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,822
Get this off!
Get him out of here, now.

1044
01:25:57,989 --> 01:25:59,448
Get him out of here, now!

1045
01:26:00,867 --> 01:26:02,994
Come on, I wanna hear it again.

1046
01:26:03,161 --> 01:26:06,414
Tell me again.
Just-- I don't know.

1047
01:26:06,789 --> 01:26:09,917
You heard nothing strange,
you saw nothing strange.

1048
01:26:10,459 --> 01:26:12,086
No.
No.

1049
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:15,464
He asked me if I was married.

1050
01:26:15,631 --> 01:26:18,676
And I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Where was the girl?

1051
01:26:18,885 --> 01:26:21,137
The what? What?

1052
01:26:21,304 --> 01:26:23,764
The girl, the prostitute.
Where was she?

1053
01:26:23,973 --> 01:26:26,434
Someone comes to
your establishment.

1054
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:29,437
They want to go downstairs
and wanna get a little ooh la la.

1055
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:31,105
Whatever.

1056
01:26:31,272 --> 01:26:34,650
They got to come to you, yeah?
Yeah.

1057
01:26:34,817 --> 01:26:36,194
You didn't see anyone?

1058
01:26:37,195 --> 01:26:40,573
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1059
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:44,994
Hey, everybody that comes in there's
got a package under their arms.

1060
01:26:45,161 --> 01:26:48,539
Some guys are carrying
suitcases full of stuff.

1061
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:51,334
She was
just sitting on the bed.

1062
01:26:57,798 --> 01:27:00,134
Who tied her down?
You or him?

1063
01:27:00,635 --> 01:27:02,929
Do you like what you
do for a living?

1064
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:06,015
These things you see?
No.

1065
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:08,809
No, I don't.

1066
01:27:10,311 --> 01:27:12,980
But that's life, isn't it?

1067
01:27:16,609 --> 01:27:22,323
He had a gun and he
made it happen.

1068
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:25,868
He made me do it.

1069
01:27:26,035 --> 01:27:29,538
He put that thing on me.

1070
01:27:29,705 --> 01:27:32,333
And he made me wear it.

1071
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:36,504
Then he told me to fuck her.

1072
01:27:37,964 --> 01:27:40,174
And I did. I fucked her.

1073
01:27:40,967 --> 01:27:42,426
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1074
01:27:42,593 --> 01:27:44,595
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1075
01:27:44,762 --> 01:27:48,391
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1076
01:27:48,975 --> 01:27:50,017
<i>Fuck.</i>

1077
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,605
<i>Oh, God, God.</i>

1078
01:27:54,772 --> 01:27:57,650
<i>God, help me.
Please, please, help me.</i>

1079
01:27:57,817 --> 01:27:59,527
<i>Please, please, help me.</i>

1080
01:28:16,836 --> 01:28:19,588
You know, this isn't gonna
have a happy ending.

1081
01:28:19,755 --> 01:28:23,175
It's not possible.
Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1082
01:28:25,386 --> 01:28:28,097
If we catch John Doe
and he turns out to be the devil--

1083
01:28:28,264 --> 01:28:32,059
I mean, if he's Satan himself, that
might live up to our expectations...

1084
01:28:32,226 --> 01:28:35,104
...but he's not the devil.

1085
01:28:36,731 --> 01:28:38,232
He's just a man.

1086
01:28:39,108 --> 01:28:40,735
You know...

1087
01:28:40,901 --> 01:28:43,738
...see, you bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things. These:

1088
01:28:45,531 --> 01:28:49,493
If you think you're preparing me
for hard times, thank you, but...

1089
01:28:50,161 --> 01:28:52,830
But you gotta be a hero.

1090
01:28:53,622 --> 01:28:56,917
You wanna be a champion. Let me
tell you, people don't want a champion.

1091
01:28:57,084 --> 01:28:59,587
They wanna eat cheeseburgers,
play lotto and watch TV.

1092
01:28:59,754 --> 01:29:01,505
How did you get like this?

1093
01:29:02,089 --> 01:29:04,884
I wanna know.
Ah.

1094
01:29:07,928 --> 01:29:10,431
It wasn't one thing,
I can tell you that.

1095
01:29:11,974 --> 01:29:13,267
Go on.

1096
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:20,941
I just don't think I can continue to live in
a place that embraces and nurtures apathy...

1097
01:29:21,108 --> 01:29:23,361
...as if it was a virtue.

1098
01:29:23,944 --> 01:29:25,446
You're no different,
no better.

1099
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,407
I didn't say I was different
or better. I'm not.

1100
01:29:28,574 --> 01:29:31,619
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1101
01:29:31,786 --> 01:29:34,121
Apathy is a solution.

1102
01:29:34,288 --> 01:29:38,918
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1103
01:29:39,085 --> 01:29:41,128
Yeah.
It's easier to steal what you want...

1104
01:29:41,295 --> 01:29:42,797
...than it is to earn it.
Yeah.

1105
01:29:42,963 --> 01:29:45,299
It's easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it.

1106
01:29:45,466 --> 01:29:48,260
Hell, love costs.
It takes effort and work.

1107
01:29:48,427 --> 01:29:50,971
We are talking about
people who are mentally ill.

1108
01:29:51,138 --> 01:29:53,849
We are talking about
people, fucking crazies.

1109
01:29:54,016 --> 01:29:55,476
No. No, we're not.
Yes, today.

1110
01:29:55,643 --> 01:29:58,896
We're talking about
everyday life here.

1111
01:30:00,272 --> 01:30:02,650
You can't afford to
be this naive.

1112
01:30:02,817 --> 01:30:04,402
Fuck off.

1113
01:30:04,568 --> 01:30:08,823
See, you should listen
to yourself. Yeah.

1114
01:30:08,989 --> 01:30:12,660
You say that the problem
with people is that they don't care.

1115
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:15,496
So I don't care about people.

1116
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,373
It makes no sense.
You know why?

1117
01:30:17,832 --> 01:30:19,834
Uh, you care?
You wanna know--?

1118
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,503
Damn right.
And you're gonna make a difference?

1119
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:26,966
Whatever, the point is, is that I
don't think you're quitting...

1120
01:30:27,133 --> 01:30:30,344
...because you believe these things
you say. I don't.

1121
01:30:30,511 --> 01:30:34,014
I think you wanna believe them
because you're quitting.

1122
01:30:35,683 --> 01:30:39,103
You want me to agree and say,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1123
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,230
It's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess.

1124
01:30:41,397 --> 01:30:44,817
We should all go live
in a fucking log cabin."

1125
01:30:45,443 --> 01:30:47,194
But I won't.

1126
01:30:47,361 --> 01:30:49,488
I won't say that.

1127
01:30:50,322 --> 01:30:53,742
I don't agree with you.
I do not.

1128
01:30:57,371 --> 01:30:58,914
I can't.

1129
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,176
I'm gonna go home.

1130
01:31:17,892 --> 01:31:19,560
Thank you, though.

1131
01:31:49,757 --> 01:31:51,592
I love you, honey.

1132
01:31:52,092 --> 01:31:54,220
So much.

1133
01:31:55,429 --> 01:31:57,431
So much.

1134
01:32:01,727 --> 01:32:03,479
I know.

1135
01:33:05,499 --> 01:33:08,002
911, what's your emergency?

1136
01:33:08,836 --> 01:33:09,878
Could you repeat that?

1137
01:33:10,045 --> 01:33:13,507
<i>I've gone and done it again.</i>

1138
01:33:23,559 --> 01:33:24,768
What have we got?

1139
01:33:25,102 --> 01:33:27,354
Uh, sleeping pills.

1140
01:33:28,105 --> 01:33:29,690
Glued to one hand.

1141
01:33:29,857 --> 01:33:31,400
Telephone glued to the other.

1142
01:33:33,193 --> 01:33:34,361
You see what he did?

1143
01:33:35,487 --> 01:33:36,864
He sliced her up.

1144
01:33:37,489 --> 01:33:38,949
Then he bandaged her.

1145
01:33:39,533 --> 01:33:41,535
Call for help and you'll live.

1146
01:33:41,702 --> 01:33:43,996
But you'll be disfigured.

1147
01:33:44,872 --> 01:33:47,916
Or you can put yourself
out of your own misery.

1148
01:33:48,959 --> 01:33:50,044
Come on.

1149
01:33:50,377 --> 01:33:51,545
Cut off her nose.

1150
01:33:51,712 --> 01:33:53,380
To spite her face.

1151
01:33:53,547 --> 01:33:56,216
And he did it very recently.

1152
01:34:03,265 --> 01:34:04,725
Listen.

1153
01:34:05,392 --> 01:34:10,397
I've decided to stay on till this is done.
I figure one of two things will happen.

1154
01:34:10,564 --> 01:34:15,194
We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series
of seven and this case will go on for years.

1155
01:34:15,361 --> 01:34:18,572
Hey man, you don't have to do me
any favors. Thank you, but I got it.

1156
01:34:18,739 --> 01:34:22,076
I'm requesting that you keep me
on as your partner for a few more days.

1157
01:34:22,242 --> 01:34:24,161
You'd be doing me a favor.

1158
01:34:34,838 --> 01:34:36,382
You knew I'd say yes.

1159
01:34:36,548 --> 01:34:38,008
Hey, we're here.
Wonderful.

1160
01:34:38,175 --> 01:34:41,637
Your wife called.
Get yourself an answering machine.

1161
01:34:43,806 --> 01:34:45,474
Detective?

1162
01:34:46,684 --> 01:34:48,936
After this, I'm gone.

1163
01:34:49,436 --> 01:34:51,939
No big surprise.
Detective!

1164
01:34:54,942 --> 01:34:56,318
You're looking for me.

1165
01:34:56,777 --> 01:34:57,778
Hey!

1166
01:34:59,154 --> 01:35:01,615
Don't you fucking move.
On the fucking floor.

1167
01:35:01,782 --> 01:35:03,075
Keep away from him!

1168
01:35:03,242 --> 01:35:04,952
On the fucking floor.
I know you.

1169
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,495
Now. Get down.

1170
01:35:07,204 --> 01:35:09,915
Get down on your stomach,
you piece of shit.

1171
01:35:10,082 --> 01:35:11,959
Now. All the way!

1172
01:35:12,126 --> 01:35:14,294
All the way, fucker! Down!

1173
01:35:14,461 --> 01:35:17,005
Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.

1174
01:35:17,172 --> 01:35:20,426
Now. Nose on the ground.

1175
01:35:23,262 --> 01:35:26,056
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is this?

1176
01:35:26,223 --> 01:35:29,393
I'd like to speak to
my lawyer, please.

1177
01:35:31,145 --> 01:35:33,021
Goddamn it.

1178
01:35:34,815 --> 01:35:36,984
He cuts the skin off
the tips of his fingers.

1179
01:35:37,151 --> 01:35:41,405
That's why we couldn't find one
single usable print in his apartment.

1180
01:35:41,572 --> 01:35:43,907
Looks like he's been doing it
for a quite sometime.

1181
01:35:44,074 --> 01:35:46,493
What about the
bank accounts? The guns?

1182
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,495
So far
everything's a dead end.

1183
01:35:48,662 --> 01:35:51,415
No credit history.
No employment records.

1184
01:35:51,582 --> 01:35:55,335
His bank account's only 5 years old
and it was started with cash.

1185
01:35:55,502 --> 01:35:57,379
We're even trying
to trace his furniture.

1186
01:35:57,546 --> 01:35:59,965
About only thing we know
about that guy right now...

1187
01:36:00,132 --> 01:36:04,970
...is that he's independently wealthy,
well-educated and totally insane.

1188
01:36:05,137 --> 01:36:07,139
Because he's John Doe
by choice.

1189
01:36:07,306 --> 01:36:09,850
Okay, so when do we get to question him?
You don't.

1190
01:36:10,017 --> 01:36:11,852
He going to court now.
What?

1191
01:36:12,019 --> 01:36:14,480
I'm telling you, there's no
way he'd turn himself in.

1192
01:36:14,646 --> 01:36:16,273
It doesn't make any sense.

1193
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:20,027
Well, there he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1194
01:36:20,194 --> 01:36:22,863
He's not finished.
No, he's pissing in our faces.

1195
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:27,284
We're just taking it like idiots.
You know what I'm talking about.

1196
01:36:27,451 --> 01:36:31,371
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1197
01:36:31,622 --> 01:36:35,042
He wouldn't just stop.
Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?

1198
01:36:35,209 --> 01:36:38,420
He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1199
01:36:39,838 --> 01:36:41,924
We'll wait for his plea.

1200
01:36:45,052 --> 01:36:49,640
My client says there are two more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1201
01:36:49,807 --> 01:36:52,601
He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies...

1202
01:36:52,768 --> 01:36:56,939
...but only Detective Mills and
Somerset, only at 6:00 today.

1203
01:36:57,105 --> 01:36:58,690
Why us?

1204
01:36:58,857 --> 01:37:00,317
He says he admires you.

1205
01:37:02,069 --> 01:37:03,403
It's part of the game.

1206
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:06,323
The client claims if the
detectives do not accept this...

1207
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:10,410
...these bodies will never be found.
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1208
01:37:10,577 --> 01:37:11,829
Hey.

1209
01:37:11,995 --> 01:37:13,247
We've got him.

1210
01:37:13,413 --> 01:37:15,624
Downstairs, locked up.
Done deal.

1211
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:18,836
He's gonna get his free room and
board, get his free cable TV.

1212
01:37:19,002 --> 01:37:22,464
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we having this conversation?

1213
01:37:22,631 --> 01:37:25,092
Mills.
No. Hey, something stinks.

1214
01:37:25,259 --> 01:37:26,426
And this one here--

1215
01:37:26,593 --> 01:37:30,264
Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face...

1216
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:33,016
...dealing for that shit, I don't like it--
Mills.

1217
01:37:33,183 --> 01:37:35,435
I am required by law
to serve my clients...

1218
01:37:35,602 --> 01:37:37,354
...to the best of my ability.
Aw, Jesus.

1219
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:40,983
To serve their best interest.
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1220
01:37:41,149 --> 01:37:43,569
My client wishes inform you
if you do not accept...

1221
01:37:43,735 --> 01:37:46,363
...he will plead insanity
across the board.

1222
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:48,198
Let him try it.

1223
01:37:48,365 --> 01:37:49,491
I'd like to see him try.

1224
01:37:49,658 --> 01:37:52,661
Come on, now, we all know the
extreme nature of these crimes...

1225
01:37:52,828 --> 01:37:55,247
...I could get him off
with such a plea.

1226
01:37:55,414 --> 01:37:58,125
I'm not letting this conviction
slide. I can tell you that.

1227
01:37:58,292 --> 01:38:01,920
He says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions...

1228
01:38:02,087 --> 01:38:04,715
...he'll sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1229
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:07,301
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1230
01:38:09,094 --> 01:38:10,721
Full confession.

1231
01:38:10,888 --> 01:38:13,682
I'm in.
It has to be the both of you.

1232
01:38:15,142 --> 01:38:20,606
If he were to claim insanity,
this conversation is admissible.

1233
01:38:20,772 --> 01:38:23,025
The fact that he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1234
01:38:23,191 --> 01:38:25,819
And my client would like to
remind you two more are dead.

1235
01:38:25,986 --> 01:38:27,487
Press would have a field day...

1236
01:38:27,654 --> 01:38:30,616
...if they find out the police
didn't seem concerned about them.

1237
01:38:30,782 --> 01:38:33,994
Giving them a proper burial.
If in fact there are two more dead.

1238
01:38:34,161 --> 01:38:38,332
Lab report came up from downtown. They
did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.

1239
01:38:38,498 --> 01:38:42,002
They found blood from Doe.
From him slicing his fingers.

1240
01:38:42,169 --> 01:38:44,796
Blood from the woman
who's face he cut off.

1241
01:38:44,963 --> 01:38:49,676
And blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.

1242
01:38:52,888 --> 01:38:54,973
You'd be escorting an
unarmed man.

1243
01:38:58,018 --> 01:38:59,478
Let's finish it.

1244
01:39:03,106 --> 01:39:06,109
If John Doe's head splits
open and a UFO should fly out...

1245
01:39:06,526 --> 01:39:09,029
...I want you to have expected it.

1246
01:39:10,697 --> 01:39:12,366
I Will.

1247
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:16,912
Hey, man, if I was to accidentally
shave off a nipple...

1248
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:18,705
...would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1249
01:39:18,872 --> 01:39:19,873
Hmm.

1250
01:39:24,086 --> 01:39:26,171
I suppose so.

1251
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,382
Yeah.
If you were man enough...

1252
01:39:28,548 --> 01:39:32,761
...to actually file a claim,
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1253
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,974
If I keep coming home late, my
wife's gonna think something's up.

1254
01:39:46,066 --> 01:39:47,567
You know...

1255
01:39:48,735 --> 01:39:50,028
Yeah.

1256
01:39:55,867 --> 01:39:57,160
What?

1257
01:41:08,774 --> 01:41:09,983
Let's go.

1258
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:42,849
<i>C-Victor -5-5 take. Clear the TC.</i>

1259
01:41:43,016 --> 01:41:44,267
Pull around.

1260
01:41:45,685 --> 01:41:48,772
<i>There it is. Late-model black
sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>

1261
01:41:58,031 --> 01:41:59,199
Who are you, John?

1262
01:42:00,283 --> 01:42:02,077
Who are you really?

1263
01:42:02,369 --> 01:42:03,453
What do you mean?

1264
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:07,374
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us a bit about yourself?

1265
01:42:07,874 --> 01:42:11,044
It doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1266
01:42:11,211 --> 01:42:13,130
You need to stay on
your left up here.

1267
01:42:17,384 --> 01:42:19,094
So where are we heading?

1268
01:42:19,761 --> 01:42:20,804
You'll see.

1269
01:42:21,555 --> 01:42:25,058
We're not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies, are we, John?

1270
01:42:25,559 --> 01:42:27,435
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1271
01:42:27,602 --> 01:42:30,730
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1272
01:42:31,815 --> 01:42:34,025
Wanting people to listen...

1273
01:42:34,192 --> 01:42:37,737
...you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.

1274
01:42:37,904 --> 01:42:40,282
You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.

1275
01:42:40,448 --> 01:42:43,410
And then you'll notice
you've got their strict attention.

1276
01:42:43,577 --> 01:42:45,453
But the question is:

1277
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:48,290
What makes you so special
that people should listen?

1278
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,958
I'm not special.

1279
01:42:51,084 --> 01:42:53,587
<i>I've never been exceptional.</i>

1280
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,591
<i>This is, though, what I'm doing.
My work.</i>

1281
01:42:58,049 --> 01:42:59,342
Your work, John?

1282
01:42:59,926 --> 01:43:01,052
Yes.

1283
01:43:01,219 --> 01:43:04,181
See, I don't-- I don't see
anything special about it, John.

1284
01:43:05,599 --> 01:43:06,641
That's not true.

1285
01:43:06,808 --> 01:43:07,893
No, it is true.

1286
01:43:08,059 --> 01:43:11,229
And the funny thing is,
all this work...

1287
01:43:11,396 --> 01:43:13,398
...two months from now,
no one's gonna care.

1288
01:43:13,565 --> 01:43:15,901
No one's gonna give a shit,
no one's gonna remember.

1289
01:43:16,067 --> 01:43:19,112
You can't see the whole
complete act yet.

1290
01:43:19,863 --> 01:43:21,448
But when this is done...

1291
01:43:22,782 --> 01:43:24,117
...when it's finished...

1292
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,454
...it's going to be...

1293
01:43:30,457 --> 01:43:33,793
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1294
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,004
But they won't be able to deny.

1295
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:39,090
Could the freak be more vague?

1296
01:43:40,258 --> 01:43:42,510
I mean, as far as master
plans go, John--

1297
01:43:42,677 --> 01:43:46,514
I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.
It's really going to be something.

1298
01:43:47,599 --> 01:43:50,310
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be standing next to you.

1299
01:43:50,477 --> 01:43:53,730
So when this big thing happens,
you be sure and let me know.

1300
01:43:53,897 --> 01:43:57,400
Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.
Oh, don't worry.

1301
01:43:57,567 --> 01:43:58,610
You won't.

1302
01:44:00,612 --> 01:44:02,739
You won't miss a thing.

1303
01:44:09,329 --> 01:44:12,624
<i>With the tour bus
itself, give two miles separation.</i>

1304
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:30,725
What's so exciting?

1305
01:44:31,935 --> 01:44:33,853
It's not too far now.

1306
01:44:37,565 --> 01:44:39,317
<i>High-tension lines ahead.</i>

1307
01:44:39,484 --> 01:44:40,652
<i>Prepare for
frequency change.</i>

1308
01:44:41,278 --> 01:44:43,571
I've been trying to figure
something in my head.

1309
01:44:43,738 --> 01:44:46,116
And maybe you can help
me out, yeah?

1310
01:44:47,534 --> 01:44:51,705
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are...

1311
01:44:51,871 --> 01:44:54,207
...do you know that
you're insane?

1312
01:44:54,374 --> 01:44:56,793
Maybe you're sitting around,
reading Guns and Ammo...

1313
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,213
...masturbating in your own feces,
do you just stop and go:

1314
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:03,883
"Wow, it is amazing how
fucking crazy I really am"?

1315
01:45:04,217 --> 01:45:06,553
Yeah?
Do you guys do that?

1316
01:45:07,387 --> 01:45:10,056
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1317
01:45:10,223 --> 01:45:11,433
It's very comfortable.

1318
01:45:12,225 --> 01:45:15,562
It's not something I would
expect you to accept.

1319
01:45:15,937 --> 01:45:18,732
But I did not choose.
I was chosen.

1320
01:45:19,149 --> 01:45:22,777
Well, whatever.
I don't doubt that you believe that, John.

1321
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:27,407
But seems to me that you're
overlooking a glaring contradiction.

1322
01:45:27,574 --> 01:45:28,825
Meaning what?

1323
01:45:30,035 --> 01:45:31,953
Glad you asked.

1324
01:45:33,288 --> 01:45:34,914
If you were chosen...

1325
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:38,918
...that is, by a higher power...

1326
01:45:39,669 --> 01:45:41,504
...and if your hand was forced...

1327
01:45:42,088 --> 01:45:45,175
...it seems strange to me that you'd
get such enjoyment out of it.

1328
01:45:45,842 --> 01:45:48,720
You enjoyed torturing
those people.

1329
01:45:49,429 --> 01:45:52,932
This doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?

1330
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:55,310
John?

1331
01:46:00,148 --> 01:46:03,026
I doubt I enjoyed it any
more than Detective Mills...

1332
01:46:03,193 --> 01:46:06,905
...would enjoy time alone with me
in a room without windows.

1333
01:46:07,489 --> 01:46:09,282
Isn't that true?

1334
01:46:09,616 --> 01:46:12,535
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity.

1335
01:46:12,702 --> 01:46:13,787
That hurts my feelings.

1336
01:46:15,372 --> 01:46:18,541
I would never--
You wouldn't because there's consequences.

1337
01:46:20,043 --> 01:46:22,670
It's in those eyes
of yours, though.

1338
01:46:22,837 --> 01:46:25,507
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1339
01:46:26,257 --> 01:46:31,179
I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.

1340
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:35,433
Wait a minute, I thought all you
did was kill innocent people.

1341
01:46:37,435 --> 01:46:40,021
Innocent?
Is that supposed to be funny?

1342
01:46:40,897 --> 01:46:42,357
An obese man.

1343
01:46:42,524 --> 01:46:45,026
A disgusting man who
could barely stand up.

1344
01:46:45,193 --> 01:46:49,489
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your
friends so they'd join you in mocking him.

1345
01:46:49,656 --> 01:46:51,950
A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating...

1346
01:46:52,117 --> 01:46:54,661
...you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

1347
01:46:54,953 --> 01:46:58,498
And after him, lawyer. You must've
secretly been thanking me for that one.

1348
01:46:58,998 --> 01:47:01,918
This is a man who
dedicated his life...

1349
01:47:02,085 --> 01:47:06,714
...to making money by lying with
every breath that he could muster...

1350
01:47:06,881 --> 01:47:09,759
...to keeping murderers and
rapists on the streets.

1351
01:47:09,926 --> 01:47:11,344
Murderers?
A woman.

1352
01:47:11,511 --> 01:47:13,596
Murderers, John, like yourself?
A woman...

1353
01:47:13,763 --> 01:47:16,474
...so ugly inside that she
couldn't bear to go on living...

1354
01:47:16,641 --> 01:47:18,935
...if she couldn't be
beautiful on the outside?

1355
01:47:19,102 --> 01:47:23,523
A drug dealer. A drug
dealing pederast, actually.

1356
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:26,359
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1357
01:47:28,611 --> 01:47:31,030
Only in a world this shitty...

1358
01:47:31,197 --> 01:47:34,909
...could you try to say these were
innocent people and keep a straight face.

1359
01:47:38,121 --> 01:47:39,998
But that's the point.

1360
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:44,210
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1361
01:47:44,377 --> 01:47:47,255
...in every home and we tolerate it.

1362
01:47:47,922 --> 01:47:50,675
We tolerate it
because it's common, it's...

1363
01:47:50,842 --> 01:47:52,510
It's trivial.

1364
01:47:52,677 --> 01:47:55,638
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1365
01:47:58,725 --> 01:48:00,894
Well, not anymore.

1366
01:48:02,896 --> 01:48:05,273
I'm setting the example.

1367
01:48:06,274 --> 01:48:07,984
And what I've done is gonna be...

1368
01:48:08,151 --> 01:48:09,903
...puzzled over...

1369
01:48:10,069 --> 01:48:11,905
...and studied...

1370
01:48:12,697 --> 01:48:14,407
...and followed...

1371
01:48:15,909 --> 01:48:16,951
...forever.

1372
01:48:17,744 --> 01:48:19,537
Yeah.

1373
01:48:20,413 --> 01:48:22,749
Delusions of grandeur.

1374
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:25,418
You should be thanking me.

1375
01:48:25,919 --> 01:48:27,128
Why's that, John?

1376
01:48:27,295 --> 01:48:30,423
Because you're going
to be remembered after this.

1377
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:34,427
Realize, detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now...

1378
01:48:34,594 --> 01:48:36,638
...is that I wanted to be.

1379
01:48:36,804 --> 01:48:39,307
No. No, we would've
got you eventually.

1380
01:48:39,474 --> 01:48:40,767
Oh, really?

1381
01:48:40,934 --> 01:48:45,188
So, what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

1382
01:48:45,772 --> 01:48:51,194
Allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap?

1383
01:48:51,361 --> 01:48:55,448
Tell me, what was the indisputable
evidence you were going to use on me...

1384
01:48:55,615 --> 01:49:00,078
...right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?

1385
01:49:00,245 --> 01:49:02,455
John, calm down.

1386
01:49:02,622 --> 01:49:04,999
I seem to remember us
knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:07,168
Oh, that's right.

1388
01:49:07,335 --> 01:49:10,672
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:49:15,426 --> 01:49:18,263
You're only alive because
I didn't kill you.

1390
01:49:18,429 --> 01:49:20,390
Okay, sit back.
I spared you.

1391
01:49:20,557 --> 01:49:21,599
Sit back.

1392
01:49:21,766 --> 01:49:24,060
Remember that every time
you look in the mirror...

1393
01:49:24,227 --> 01:49:26,938
...at that face of yours
for the rest of your life...

1394
01:49:27,105 --> 01:49:28,773
...or should I say for the rest...

1395
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:31,317
...of what life I allow you to have.
Sit back.

1396
01:49:31,484 --> 01:49:35,071
Sit back, you fucking freak.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1397
01:49:36,698 --> 01:49:39,450
You're no messiah.
You're a movie of the week.

1398
01:49:39,617 --> 01:49:43,204
You're a fucking T-shirt at best.

1399
01:49:56,301 --> 01:49:58,553
Don't ask me to pity
those people.

1400
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,138
I don't mourn them any more...

1401
01:50:00,305 --> 01:50:02,849
...than the thousands that died
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:03,182 --> 01:50:07,645
Is that to say, John, that what you
were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:10,898 --> 01:50:14,193
The Lord works in
mysterious ways.

1404
01:50:16,112 --> 01:50:18,239
Do you see those
high-tension towers?

1405
01:50:18,698 --> 01:50:21,034
<i>That's where we're headed.</i>
<i>I see where.</i>

1406
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:23,536
<i>Right to your 9 o'clock</i>
<i>and follow that access road.</i>

1407
01:50:29,876 --> 01:50:32,045
<i>Your signal's
breaking up, Viking.</i>

1408
01:50:32,211 --> 01:50:35,673
<i>Un-fucking-avoidable, Center.</i>
<i>We're in power-line city, deal with it.</i>

1409
01:50:37,175 --> 01:50:40,011
This sure as shit is no
ambush out here.

1410
01:50:40,178 --> 01:50:42,930
No fucking nothing out here.
Can't land anywhere near.

1411
01:50:43,097 --> 01:50:45,933
They're gonna be coming up
behind us in about two minutes.

1412
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,353
I want you to go up,
way up.

1413
01:50:48,519 --> 01:50:51,648
Thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.

1414
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,461
I'm getting him out.

1415
01:51:57,547 --> 01:51:59,632
<i>Target is now fully into standby.</i>

1416
01:52:00,466 --> 01:52:01,467
<i>Got you in sight.</i>

1417
01:52:01,634 --> 01:52:03,052
<i>Get out.</i>

1418
01:52:03,594 --> 01:52:05,430
Slowly.

1419
01:52:05,722 --> 01:52:07,223
Stop.

1420
01:52:07,765 --> 01:52:09,308
Stay.

1421
01:52:12,061 --> 01:52:13,771
What do you got?

1422
01:52:14,897 --> 01:52:16,649
Dead dog.

1423
01:52:17,942 --> 01:52:19,485
I didn't do that.

1424
01:52:23,156 --> 01:52:25,324
<i>We're holdin on standby, copy?</i>

1425
01:52:26,325 --> 01:52:27,410
What time is it?

1426
01:52:28,327 --> 01:52:30,913
Why?
I'd like to know.

1427
01:52:34,292 --> 01:52:35,376
Seven-oh-one.

1428
01:52:38,671 --> 01:52:39,756
It's close.

1429
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,008
Let's go take a look.

1430
01:52:45,762 --> 01:52:46,804
It's this way.

1431
01:52:49,849 --> 01:52:51,893
<i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i>

1432
01:52:52,059 --> 01:52:54,604
<i>This is Bird 2.
They're away from the car.</i>

1433
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:56,939
<i>Coming in closer.</i>

1434
01:52:58,816 --> 01:53:02,195
<i>We got them.
We got them. Closing in.</i>

1435
01:53:02,361 --> 01:53:03,988
<i> Negative.
Negative. Hold your go.</i>

1436
01:53:29,972 --> 01:53:31,057
Mills?

1437
01:53:35,311 --> 01:53:38,356
Down, down, down.

1438
01:53:39,357 --> 01:53:40,858
Watch him.

1439
01:53:42,109 --> 01:53:43,945
There he goes.

1440
01:53:44,153 --> 01:53:46,322
<i>It's good we
have some time to talk.</i>

1441
01:53:50,409 --> 01:53:51,828
<i>Van approaching.</i>

1442
01:53:51,994 --> 01:53:55,414
Stay on the guy in red. Do not take
the crosshairs off the guy in red.

1443
01:54:00,044 --> 01:54:02,672
<i>He's going out to meet
the van. Just stay down.</i>

1444
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:06,300
There's a van coming down the road.
From the north.

1445
01:54:15,476 --> 01:54:18,062
Be ready for anything, now.
Wait for my signal.

1446
01:54:18,229 --> 01:54:19,856
Wait for me.

1447
01:54:25,278 --> 01:54:27,321
Get out of the van!

1448
01:54:28,739 --> 01:54:29,782
<i>Out!</i>

1449
01:54:29,949 --> 01:54:32,118
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.

1450
01:54:32,285 --> 01:54:33,953
Step away.

1451
01:54:34,412 --> 01:54:36,622
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1452
01:54:36,789 --> 01:54:38,958
What the hell is going on?

1453
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:41,919
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
I'm delivering a package.

1454
01:54:42,086 --> 01:54:43,796
I got this package for
this guy, David.

1455
01:54:43,963 --> 01:54:47,258
Uh, Detective David Mills.

1456
01:54:54,223 --> 01:54:56,559
Get it.
Slowly.

1457
01:54:57,435 --> 01:54:59,979
<i>Stay alert.
He's opening the back of the van.</i>

1458
01:55:00,146 --> 01:55:01,814
<i>We've got him in sight.</i>

1459
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:11,324
This guy paid me 500 bucks
to bring it out here, man.

1460
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:13,576
He said he wanted it here
at exactly 7:00.

1461
01:55:14,327 --> 01:55:15,828
Put it down.

1462
01:55:16,454 --> 01:55:17,788
We got a box.

1463
01:55:17,955 --> 01:55:22,251
We got a box. Call the bomb squad.
I need a bomb squad. We got a box.

1464
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:24,420
Face the van.

1465
01:55:24,795 --> 01:55:26,255
Hands up.

1466
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:35,306
Turn around.

1467
01:55:36,182 --> 01:55:38,100
Okay. Go.
Off you go. Go.

1468
01:55:38,267 --> 01:55:40,394
<i>Do you want us
to pick this guy up?</i>

1469
01:55:41,312 --> 01:55:43,314
I'm sending the driver
out on foot.

1470
01:55:46,192 --> 01:55:50,154
<i>Got the driver in sight.</i>
He's headed north. Have him picked up.

1471
01:55:59,413 --> 01:56:01,332
Oh, I don't know.

1472
01:56:07,546 --> 01:56:09,048
I'm gonna open it.

1473
01:56:09,215 --> 01:56:13,094
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1474
01:56:31,737 --> 01:56:32,822
It's blood.

1475
01:56:32,989 --> 01:56:34,740
You've made
quite a life for yourself.

1476
01:56:34,907 --> 01:56:35,950
Hmm.

1477
01:56:36,117 --> 01:56:39,245
You should be very proud.
Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1478
01:56:52,925 --> 01:56:54,343
<i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>

1479
01:57:06,939 --> 01:57:08,399
California,
stay away from here.

1480
01:57:08,566 --> 01:57:11,027
Stay away from here, now.
Don't come in here.

1481
01:57:11,485 --> 01:57:13,195
<i>Whatever you hear,
stay away.</i>

1482
01:57:14,405 --> 01:57:17,491
John Doe has the upper hand.
Mills!

1483
01:57:17,908 --> 01:57:19,035
Here he comes.

1484
01:57:19,201 --> 01:57:21,078
Throw your gun down!
What?

1485
01:57:21,245 --> 01:57:23,456
I wish I could've lived like you.
Shut up.

1486
01:57:23,622 --> 01:57:26,417
What the fuck you talking about?
Go away!

1487
01:57:26,584 --> 01:57:27,877
Do you hear me, detective?

1488
01:57:28,044 --> 01:57:32,381
I'm trying to tell you how much
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1489
01:57:33,466 --> 01:57:35,301
What?
Tracy.

1490
01:57:35,468 --> 01:57:36,677
Mills!

1491
01:57:36,844 --> 01:57:37,928
What'd you fucking say?

1492
01:57:38,095 --> 01:57:42,183
It's disturbing how easily a member of
the press can purchase information...

1493
01:57:42,349 --> 01:57:44,060
...from the men in your precinct.

1494
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,062
What the fuck?

1495
01:57:46,479 --> 01:57:48,355
<i>Throw your gun down!</i>

1496
01:57:48,522 --> 01:57:50,566
I visited your home this morning...

1497
01:57:51,567 --> 01:57:53,360
After you'd left.

1498
01:57:53,527 --> 01:57:55,654
Mills!
I tried to play husband.

1499
01:57:56,322 --> 01:57:59,575
I tried to taste the
life of a simple man.

1500
01:57:59,784 --> 01:58:01,035
Throw it away!

1501
01:58:01,202 --> 01:58:03,496
Tsk, it didn't work out.

1502
01:58:03,662 --> 01:58:05,331
So...

1503
01:58:05,498 --> 01:58:07,416
I took a souvenir.

1504
01:58:09,043 --> 01:58:10,753
Her pretty head.

1505
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:12,505
Mills.

1506
01:58:13,047 --> 01:58:14,673
Mills.

1507
01:58:15,674 --> 01:58:16,842
What's he talking about?

1508
01:58:17,009 --> 01:58:19,386
Give me your gun.
What's going on over there?

1509
01:58:19,553 --> 01:58:20,846
Put the, ugh--
Put the gun down.

1510
01:58:21,013 --> 01:58:23,015
I saw you with a box.
What was in the box?

1511
01:58:23,182 --> 01:58:26,102
Because I envy your normal life.
Put the gun down, David.

1512
01:58:26,268 --> 01:58:29,230
It seems that envy is my sin.
Oh, what's in the box?

1513
01:58:29,396 --> 01:58:31,732
Not until you give me the gun.
What's in the box?

1514
01:58:31,899 --> 01:58:33,651
Give me the gun.
He just told you.

1515
01:58:33,818 --> 01:58:37,446
You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.
David.

1516
01:58:37,613 --> 01:58:40,366
That's what he wants.
He wants you to shoot him.

1517
01:58:40,533 --> 01:58:43,661
No! No.

1518
01:58:44,036 --> 01:58:45,830
You tell me that's not true.

1519
01:58:45,996 --> 01:58:48,124
That's not true.
Become vengeance, David.

1520
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:51,168
Oh, she's all right. You tell me.
Become...

1521
01:58:51,335 --> 01:58:53,838
...wrath.
Tell me she's all right!

1522
01:58:54,004 --> 01:58:56,132
If you murder a suspect, David--
No.

1523
01:58:56,298 --> 01:58:58,050
You throw
it all away, he knows it.

1524
01:58:58,217 --> 01:58:59,218
No!

1525
01:58:59,385 --> 01:59:01,387
She begged for her life.
Shut up.

1526
01:59:01,554 --> 01:59:05,224
She begged for her life and for
the life of the baby inside of her.

1527
01:59:21,282 --> 01:59:22,658
Oh.

1528
01:59:24,577 --> 01:59:25,786
He didn't know.

1529
01:59:39,758 --> 01:59:41,719
Give me the gun, David.

1530
01:59:46,682 --> 01:59:48,184
David.

1531
01:59:49,476 --> 01:59:50,895
If you kill him...

1532
01:59:52,396 --> 01:59:54,148
...he will win.

1533
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:59,695
Oh, God.

1534
01:59:59,862 --> 02:00:02,072
Oh, God.

1535
02:00:02,781 --> 02:00:03,949
Oh!

1536
02:00:17,379 --> 02:00:19,131
Oh, fuck, he shot him.

1537
02:00:41,237 --> 02:00:43,822
<i>Set it down somewhere.</i>

1538
02:00:45,032 --> 02:00:47,326
<i>Come on, set us down.</i>

1539
02:00:49,745 --> 02:00:53,540
<i>Holy Christ.
Somebody call somebody.</i>

1540
02:00:53,707 --> 02:00:55,542
<i>Call somebody.</i>

1541
02:01:10,015 --> 02:01:13,060
Well, we'll take care of him.

1542
02:01:21,735 --> 02:01:23,779
Whatever he needs.

1543
02:01:24,697 --> 02:01:26,198
Where are you gonna be?

1544
02:01:28,909 --> 02:01:30,286
Around.

1545
02:01:34,623 --> 02:01:36,542
I'll be around.

1546
02:01:40,421 --> 02:01:42,673
<i>Ernest Hemingway once wrote:</i>

1547
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:47,261
<i>"The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."</i>

1548
02:01:48,095 --> 02:01:50,681
<i>I agree with the second part.</i>
