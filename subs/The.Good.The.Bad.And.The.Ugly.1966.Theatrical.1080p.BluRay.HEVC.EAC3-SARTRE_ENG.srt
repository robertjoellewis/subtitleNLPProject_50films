1
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,934
You're...

2
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,145
...from Baker?

3
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,407
Tell Baker that I told him all that I know already.

4
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,201
Tell him I want to live in peace, understand?

5
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,079
That it's no use to go on tormenting me!

6
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,040
I know nothing at all about that case of coins.

7
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,208
Now that gold has disappeared.

8
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,753
But if he'd listened to me,
we could have avoided this altogether.

9
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,214
I went to the Army court.

10
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,007
There were no witnesses.

11
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,259
They couldn't uncover any more.

12
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,388
I can't tell Baker what happened to the money.

13
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,264
Go back and tell him that!

14
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,269
Word's around you had a visitor...

15
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,940
...and Baker knows it.

16
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,694
Name of Jackson.

17
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,742
Jackson was here...

18
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,955
...or Baker's got it all wrong.

19
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,297
He's not wrong.

20
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:59,261
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

21
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,680
...about the cash box.

22
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,353
That's not what I'm being paid for.

23
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,319
I'm only interested in
what name Jackson's hiding under now!

24
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,117
Why do you think Jackson
may be assuming another name?

25
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,661
I would have found him already.

26
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,665
When I start off to find somebody, I find them.

27
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,042
That's why they pay me.

28
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,967
What is Baker paying you?

29
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,346
That your family?

30
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,149
Yes.

31
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,402
Nice family.

32
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,907
What does he pay you for murdering me?

33
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,661
$500.

34
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,247
...to get the name!

35
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,005
The name!

36
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,557
Carson.

37
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,810
Bill Carson.

38
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,771
That's what he calls himself now.

39
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,637
Here's a lot of money: $1,000.

40
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,434
$1,000..

41
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,772
...and some in gold.

42
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,899
That's a tidy sum.

43
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,572
But when I'm paid...

44
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,116
...I always see the job through.

45
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,523
It's you.

46
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,984
Any information?

47
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,446
Too much.

48
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,825
He said quite a bit that should interest you...

49
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,495
...and one or two things that interested me.

50
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,497
Such as?

51
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,541
The name Jackson's hiding under is...

52
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,293
...Bill Carson.

53
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,506
That's your bit.

54
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,510
Keep talking.

55
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,513
He also mentioned somethin' about a certain...

56
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,766
...cash box which just happened to disappear.

57
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,310
That's my bit.

58
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,354
Anything else?

59
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,565
Not enough for you, huh?

60
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,693
Well, you don't have to worry.

61
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,195
He'll never say anything to anybody again!

62
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,115
Perfect.

63
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,617
Here you are.

64
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,619
Here, this is for you.

65
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,579
You did a good job for me.

66
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,373
Worth $500!

67
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,295
I almost forgot.

68
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,673
He gave me $1,000.

69
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,259
I think his idea was that I kill you.

70
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,019
But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid...

71
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,896
...I always follow my job through.

72
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,940
You know that.

73
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,198
No pistol, amigo.

74
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,033
It won't do you any good.

75
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,701
There are three of us.

76
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:17,514
You know that you have a face
beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?

77
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,690
But you don't look like the one who will collect it.

78
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,033
A couple of steps back.

79
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,789
Thank you.

80
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,134
How much you worth now?

81
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,886
How much?

82
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,388
$2,000!

83
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,934
That's right, $2,000.

84
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,145
Yeah, $2,000.

85
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,446
Hijo de puta que te parié!

86
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,364
You'll pay for this!

87
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,242
I hope you end up in a graveyard...

88
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,995
...with the cholera, and the rabies, and the plague!

89
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,790
Cut me loose! Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!

90
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,167
Put me down!

91
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,128
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

92
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,672
Cut me loose! Cut me loose!

93
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,592
You can still save yourself.

94
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,345
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.

95
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,138
Let me go!

96
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,100
I feel sick. The blood is rushing...

97
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,145
I'm dry.

98
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,981
Agua! Water!

99
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,282
You swine! You son of a bitch!

100
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,536
You're brave with a man who's tied up!

101
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,205
Come back!

102
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,207
Come back and fight!

103
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,168
You bastard!

104
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,587
Who the hell is that?

105
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,881
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

106
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,591
Cut it out! Cut it out!

107
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,928
I'm an honest farmer! I'm innocent of any--

108
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,599
So, you're an honest farmer.

109
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,935
You recognize this man?

110
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,312
Yeah, it's you!

111
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,025
Who says so? You can't even read.

112
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,152
Roll it up. Roll it up!

113
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,822
I'll give you a good idea where you can put it.

114
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,951
To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies
and all who gave birth to you!

115
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,787
Hey, everybody, look! Look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

116
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,955
Judas!

117
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,540
You've sold my hide!

118
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,376
But you won't enjoy any of that money, not a penny.

119
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,462
If there's justice,
that money will go to the undertakers!

120
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,549
Every penny of it. You know who you are?

121
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,010
You want to know whose son you are?

122
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,470
You don't, I do. Everybody does.

123
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,431
You're the son of a thousand fathers!

124
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,099
All bastards like you!

125
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,977
And your mother? Your mother...

126
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,478
You bastard!

127
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:58,026
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her.
I never hurt anybody!

128
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,446
...wanted in 14 counties of this state...

129
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,368
...the condemned is found guilty
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery...

130
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,664
...of citizens, state banks, and post offices...

131
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:15,710
...the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison...

132
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,630
...perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children...

133
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,552
...inciting prostitution, kidnapping, extortion...

134
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,722
...receiving stolen goods, selling stolen goods...

135
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:32,727
...passing counterfeit money,
and contrary to the laws of this state...

136
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,938
...the condemned is guilty of using...

137
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,902
Therefore, according to the powers vested in us...

138
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,447
...we sentence the accused here before us...

139
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,242
...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez...

140
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,619
...known as the "Rat"...

141
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,663
...and any other aliases he might have...

142
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,333
...to hang by the neck until dead.

143
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,795
May God have mercy on his soul. Proceed!

144
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,781
Five for you.

145
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,784
One, two, three, four...

146
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,619
...five for me.

147
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,289
Five for you...

148
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,959
...and five for me.

149
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,336
Know how much you're worth now?

150
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,296
No, how much?

151
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,006
$3,000!

152
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,596
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend.

153
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,931
Those with a rope around their neck...

154
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:54,725
...and the people who have the job
of doing the cutting.

155
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,020
Listen, the neck at the end of the rope is mine!

156
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,148
I run the risks.

157
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:04,026
So, the next time, I want more than half!

158
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,654
You may run the risks, my friend, but...

159
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,031
...I do the cutting.

160
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,994
If we cut down my percentage...

161
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,788
Cigar?

162
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,918
...it might interfere with my aim.

163
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:26,132
But if you miss, you had better miss very well.

164
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,969
Whoever double-crosses me and leaves me alive...

165
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:33,222
...he understands nothing about Tuco.

166
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,808
Nothing!

167
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,814
Wanted in 15 counties of this state...

168
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,776
...the condemned, standing before us...
sitting before us...

169
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,155
...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez...

170
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,532
...has been found guilty
by the Third District Circuit Court...

171
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:55,453
...of the following crimes:
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace...

172
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,997
...raping a virgin of the white race...

173
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,001
...and statutory rape of a minor of the black race...

174
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,922
...of derailing a train
in order to rob the passengers...

175
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,387
What'd you find out, Shorty?

176
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,348
If you ask me, it seems like a book!

177
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:19,644
An armed unit, escorting a cash box
of gold coins, meets a Yankee ambush...

178
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,188
...and only three of them are saved.

179
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,690
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

180
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,193
The thing that wasn't saved, though, was the coins.

181
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,071
But then the Army decides, of course,
it ought to hold a hearing...

182
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,280
...and Jackson's acquitted.

183
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,242
He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.

184
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,368
I know his name.

185
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,579
But you don't know
just who you're lookin' for, and I do!

186
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:42,667
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes!

187
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,005
- Where is Carson?
- All I know is Carson re-enlisted.

188
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,549
The poor guy's minus an eye.

189
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,759
He lives with a girl called Maria, who'll tell you.

190
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,303
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

191
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,388
Where is she?

192
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,392
Now, what's the name of that town'?
It's someplace very near...

193
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,729
Santa Ana.

194
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,609
Adios, half-soldier.

195
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:14,907
Hand me down a whiskey!

196
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,755
Glad they got him. A man guilty of all those crimes!

197
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:32,008
People with ropes around their necks
don't always hang.

198
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,552
What do you mean?

199
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,599
Even a filthy beggar like that
has a protecting angel.

200
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,650
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

201
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,486
Of all these crimes, the accused
has made a full, spontaneous confession.

202
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:57,742
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

203
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,120
May the Lord have mercy on his soul. Proceed.

204
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,304
Let's get the hell out of here!

205
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:52,380
What are you saying? Anybody can miss a shot?

206
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,382
Nobody misses when I'm at the end of the rope!

207
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:58,052
You never had a rope around your neck.
Well, I'm going to tell you something.

208
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,515
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass!

209
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,311
Yeah, you're right.

210
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,897
It's getting tougher.

211
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,692
The way I figure...

212
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,987
...there's really not too much future
with a sawed-off runt like you.

213
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,489
What do you mean?

214
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:22,702
'Cause I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than $3,000.

215
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,287
What do you mean?

216
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,582
I mean, our partnership is untied.

217
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,335
Oh no, not you.

218
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,337
You remain tied.

219
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,298
I'll keep the money, and you can have the rope.

220
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,553
You filthy, double-crossing bastard!
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks--

221
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,514
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

222
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,602
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

223
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:49,895
Adios.

224
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,982
You filthy bastard! Come here!

225
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,318
Come here! Cut this rope off! Get off that horse!

226
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,529
Get off that horse! You filthy coward!

227
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,780
If I ever catch you...

228
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,991
...I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

229
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,870
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up by your tongue.

230
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:10,082
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

231
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:10,166
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

232
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:16,255
Such ingratitude, after all the times
I've saved your life.

233
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,139
You wouldn't leave me here...

234
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,724
Come back!

235
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,310
Wait! Listen, Blondie!

236
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,980
Hijo de una gran puta!

237
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,978
You filthy rats!

238
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,830
Maria.

239
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,755
Is that you, Bill?

240
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,769
Who are you?

241
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,896
What do you want with me?

242
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,941
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

243
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,777
I don't know him.

244
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:05,698
You were calling to him in the dark!

245
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,452
Where is he'?

246
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,205
What are you gonna do?

247
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,917
I'll ask the questions!

248
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,296
Where is he'?

249
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,804
Where is he'?

250
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,565
That's enough!

251
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,067
I don't know where he is.

252
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,696
He packed his things ten days ago,
and went away with his unit.

253
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,323
They all left.

254
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,783
Which company? Where'd he go?

255
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,624
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.

256
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,585
They left for Santa Fe.

257
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:02,379
That's all I know. I swear!

258
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,766
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

259
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,890
Revolvers?

260
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,064
Revolvers!

261
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,984
Here's where I keep the best ones.

262
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,867
Remington, Colt, Farroute...

263
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,121
...Smith Wesson, Colt, from the Navy...

264
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,793
Jocelyn, another Remington, and this--

265
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,087
That's enough.

266
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,923
Cartridges.

267
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,309
- You wanna try the pistol, just step--
- Let's go.

268
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,519
Cartridge.

269
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,403
How much?

270
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,364
$20.

271
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,122
$50.

272
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,209
How much?

273
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,420
$100.

274
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:41,134
$200. It's all I've got!

275
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,449
Come here!

276
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,480
This morning I heard the whole thing.

277
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,774
They say Colonel Canby's closing in
with his Northerners...

278
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,652
...and no later than tomorrow
that they'll be in the city.

279
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:43,697
That's why these Southerners are getting out!

280
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,076
You see, as soon as these cowards hear
there are blue shirts around, they run.

281
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:51,079
- These rebels have no will to fight!
- Poor things.

282
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,706
They'll soon be finished.

283
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,957
We get rid of these bastards...

284
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,501
...then we begin making money on those Yankees.

285
00:38:56,543 --> 00:39:00,797
They carry gold, not paper dollars.
And they're going to beat the South.

286
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,177
Look, see that one with the white beard
sitting in the wagon?

287
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:09,056
General Sibley. He looks dead.
He's finally getting out of our hair.

288
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:12,100
Hooray for Dixie! Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

289
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,359
Where's the owner of that horse?

290
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:21,693
Please, mister, sir...

291
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,820
- ...a bad heart condition...
- Where?

292
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,323
The war has frightened me already.

293
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:29,076
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

294
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,371
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!

295
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,081
Where is he now?!

296
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,000
You leave him be! He doesn't know
who rides every horse!

297
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,836
You stay quiet, old hen!

298
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:44,424
Upstairs. Upstairs, in Room 4, senor.

299
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,598
Hear that?

300
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,065
You rotten criminals, how dare you?!

301
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,661
Your spurs.

302
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,634
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.

303
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,596
Those that come in by the door...

304
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,181
...and those that come in by the window.

305
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,601
Take off that pistol belt.

306
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,901
It's empty-

307
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,031
Mine isn't.

308
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:46,082
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

309
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,880
That could be cannon fire.

310
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:55,550
Cannon fire or storm, it's all the same to you!

311
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,639
You ever see this before, my friend?

312
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:12,400
Throw it over the roof beam.

313
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,279
That's it.

314
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,417
And get on that!

315
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,929
That's right.

316
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,431
Now, make sure the rope is tight!

317
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,685
It's got to hold the weight of a pig!

318
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,652
Now, put the rope around your neck!

319
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,327
Yes, very good.

320
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,414
It's too big for your neck?

321
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,374
We'll fix that right away.

322
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,167
I have another system.

323
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,003
A little different than yours.

324
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,256
I don't shoot the rope.

325
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,675
I shoot the legs off the stool!

326
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,764
Adios.

327
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:30,241
...guilty of the following crimes: horse theft...

328
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:50,762
And Shorty?

329
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,371
Sorry, Shorty!

330
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,666
Move, come on, let's go!

331
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,402
I don't know. As soon as I hit
the desert, I'm thirsty.

332
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:48,820
Burns, huh?

333
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:52,657
They say people with fair skin can't take too much.

334
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:20,309
Like that, you won't have to carry so much.

335
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,604
Where are we going'?

336
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:25,314
Where?

337
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,734
Where I'm going, amigo.

338
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,028
Over that way.

339
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:33,573
Another 100 miles of beautiful sunbaked sand.

340
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,743
Even the armies are afraid to march through there.

341
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,120
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

342
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,956
Canby's men are coming here...

343
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,960
...but no one will set foot in this hell...

344
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,338
...except you and me.

345
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,052
One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.

346
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,640
What was it you told me the last time?

347
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,313
"If" you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

348
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:10,193
And if you won't manage it, you'll die.

349
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,778
Only slowly.

350
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,323
Very slowly, old friend.

351
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,539
After you, please. Start walking.

352
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:22,074
Taking a rest?

353
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:26,913
Come on, Blondie, we don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

354
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:32,043
Only eight and a half hours more before sunset.

355
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:34,462
That's not too bad.

356
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,340
Come on!

357
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:42,548
And so, Blondie...

358
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,844
...it's goodbye.

359
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,699
$200,000 in gold. It's yours. Just get me water!

360
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,248
What's that you say?

361
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,833
Who the hell are you?

362
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,588
My name's Bill Carson now.

363
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,090
Surprise attack.

364
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:55,884
All dead.

365
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:59,013
My name is Jackson. Not Carson.

366
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,265
Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.

367
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:04,935
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What was that you said about the dollars?

368
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:07,104
$200,000, all mine.

369
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,941
Was the Third Cavalry's.

370
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,485
Baker has nothing.

371
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,237
The gold...

372
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:18,282
I hid the gold. The gold is safe!

373
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,909
Where? Here?

374
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,954
Talk!

375
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,457
In the cemetery.

376
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,542
Which cemetery?

377
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,962
On Sad Hill.

378
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,839
There's a grave by the...

379
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,175
Which grave'?

380
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,719
Have a name? Have a number?

381
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:41,180
Come on, you dummy, talk!

382
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,100
There's no number.

383
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,019
There's a name.

384
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,397
It's written.

385
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,322
Water!

386
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,869
You talk first, eh'? I'll give you the water later!

387
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,704
Sad Hill Cemetery, okay?

388
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:07,039
In a grave, okay.

389
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,708
But it must have a name or a number on it.

390
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:12,795
There must be 1,000, 5,000, you...!

391
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,592
Don't die.

392
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:21,011
Don't die! I'll get you water!

393
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:24,515
Stay there. Don't move, I'll get you water.

394
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,934
Don't die until later!

395
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:53,961
Get away from there!

396
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,302
He's dead.

397
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:07,641
I'll kill you!

398
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,272
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

399
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,568
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

400
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:20,154
If I were you, I'd...

401
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,030
...keep me alive.

402
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,658
What did he tell you?

403
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:26,869
A name.

404
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,913
Name on a grave.

405
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:31,874
What name?

406
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,681
Blondie, don't die.

407
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,226
Don't die! I'm your friend.

408
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:55,063
Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!

409
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,569
I'll help you. I'll help you!

410
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,614
Don't move. I'll be right back. I'll get the water.

411
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,158
Don't die like that pig.

412
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,369
Water, Blondie?

413
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,455
Don't drink! It's no good for you.

414
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,457
Feel better?

415
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:17,211
Blondie, what's the matter? Please don't die!

416
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:47,241
I've got a very sick man here.

417
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,826
But we have no more beds here.

418
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:51,328
Let him have yours!

419
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,794
- Where is Pablo Ramirez?
- Padre Ramirez.

420
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,546
He is away at the moment.

421
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,173
He should be back any day now.

422
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:07,719
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we'll take very good care of my friend.

423
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:09,346
May God be praised.

424
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,681
In case you didn't know it...

425
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:14,601
...God is on our side, too.
Because He hates the Yanks.

426
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,771
Father, is he still breathing?

427
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,940
Yes, of course.

428
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,526
You're heavy.

429
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:07,321
All right, put a fresh bandage on him.

430
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,532
Put him in my cell.

431
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,956
Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.

432
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,085
Look out for him, please. He's like a brother to me!

433
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,857
Father, did he speak'? Did he say anything'?

434
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,932
Did he ask for me? Did he speak about anything?

435
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:19,768
No, he hasn't spoken as yet. But you mustn't worry.

436
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:23,689
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him going until now.

437
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:26,608
He should regain his strength in a very short time.

438
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,904
Thank you, Father. You don't know
how much this boy's life means to me!

439
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:53,403
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

440
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,948
You're very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

441
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,701
Think, if you'd been on your own.

442
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:03,622
I mean, when...

443
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,166
...when one is ill...

444
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,961
...it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

445
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,548
Do you...

446
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,801
...you have parents, Blondie?

447
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,761
A mother?

448
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,097
Not even a mother.

449
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,140
No one.

450
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:25,894
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

451
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:29,272
We're all alone in the world.

452
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:31,358
I have you, you have me.

453
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,780
Only for a little while, I mean.

454
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,074
It had to happen now.

455
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,244
What a dirty rotten trick of fate!

456
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:45,413
We could have all that money in our hands.

457
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,381
I must tell you the truth, Blondie.

458
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:57,676
In my place, you would do the same thing.

459
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,388
It's all over for you now.

460
01:09:02,097 --> 01:09:05,058
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.

461
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,481
It's my fault! Mine, mine!

462
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:27,998
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.
If I knew that my last hour had come...

463
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:32,544
...I swear, in my place, in your place,
I would do the same thing.

464
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:37,048
I would tell about the gold. Yes, yes I would!

465
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:39,593
I would tell the name on the grave.

466
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,345
After all, what good is the money to you
if you're dead?

467
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,514
I know the name of the cemetery.

468
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:47,684
But you know how many graves there are there?

469
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:48,977
Please.

470
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,023
Please, have a little.

471
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:59,279
Coffee? Please tell me the name.

472
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:02,908
On the grave.

473
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:06,745
If I get my hands on the $200,000.

474
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,166
...I'll always honor your memory.

475
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,794
I swear it! I'll always honor your memory!

476
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,799
Come closer.

477
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,931
Tell me.

478
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,813
I'll sleep better...

479
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:37,692
...knowing my good friend...

480
01:10:37,943 --> 01:10:39,986
...is by my side...

481
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:41,571
...to protect me.

482
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:54,584
"Tuco, water. Please, water."

483
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:58,255
But if I get that name from you, I'll give you water!

484
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:08,265
All right, you dirty skunk, get your ass off the bed!

485
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,433
Come on, come on, the party's over.

486
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:12,269
The wagon is all ready to go.

487
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,521
From the way the wounded
are pouring into this place...

488
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:17,649
...we better get the hell out of here
before we get caught up in the war.

489
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:20,568
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

490
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:24,823
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

491
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,574
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

492
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:45,468
Hey, Pablo!

493
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,229
Don't you recognize me?

494
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,524
It's me, Tuco!

495
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,402
Let me embrace you.

496
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:08,658
I don't know the right thing!

497
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,956
I was just passing by here. I said to myself...

498
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:19,002
...I wonder if my brother remembers his brother.

499
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,256
Did I do wrong?

500
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:27,218
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

501
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,554
You've seen me, Tuco.

502
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,808
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

503
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:42,609
Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.

504
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,238
Let's talk about you. It's more important.

505
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:49,407
You look very well.

506
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,619
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

507
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:56,706
...you always were thin, eh Pablito?

508
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:01,461
What about our parents?

509
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,964
Only now do you think of them?

510
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,176
To begin after nine years?

511
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:12,222
Nine years?

512
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:14,974
So it's nine years.

513
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,564
Our mother has been dead a long time now.

514
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,069
Our father died only a few days ago.

515
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,071
That's why I was away.

516
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,325
He asked for you to be there.

517
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,702
But there was only me.

518
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:43,586
And you?

519
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:46,756
Outside of evil, what else have you managed to do?

520
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:51,636
It seems to me you once had a wife someplace.

521
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,141
Not one, lots of them!

522
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:58,852
One here, one there, wherever I found them.

523
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:02,856
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

524
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:06,901
What good would that be?

525
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:10,613
Just keep on the way you're going.

526
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,157
Go away.

527
01:14:13,575 --> 01:14:14,826
The Lord have mercy on your soul.

528
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:18,455
I'll go, I'll go. While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me...

529
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:22,208
...l, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother Ramirez...

530
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,252
...will tell you something.

531
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,337
You think you're better than I am.

532
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:29,090
Where we came from,
if one did not want to die of poverty...

533
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:31,551
...one became a priest or a bandit!

534
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:34,179
You chose your way, I chose mine.

535
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,930
Mine was harder.

536
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,849
You talk of our mother and father.

537
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:40,018
You remember when you left to become a priest.

538
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:41,519
I stayed behind!

539
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:45,398
I must have been ten, twelve.
I don't remember which, but I stayed.

540
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,859
I tried, but it was no good.

541
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:50,111
Now I am going to tell you something.

542
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,696
You became a priest because you were...

543
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,782
...too much of a coward to do what I do!

544
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:27,565
Please, forgive me, brother.

545
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:58,930
My belly's full.

546
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,725
Nice guy, my brother.

547
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:05,436
I didn't tell you my brother was in charge here.

548
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,730
Everything, like the pope almost.

549
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,732
He's in charge in Rome.

550
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:13,278
My brother, he says to me:
"Stay, brother, don't go home."

551
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:15,154
"We never see each other."

552
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:19,659
"Here, there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend, too."

553
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:22,078
Whenever we see each other, he never lets me go.

554
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,539
It's always the same story.

555
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:27,250
My brother, he's crazy about me.

556
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,005
That's so.

557
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:35,383
Even a tramp like me, no matter what happens...

558
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:41,723
...I know there's a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.

559
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,517
Sure.

560
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:49,856
Well, after a meal,
there's nothing like a good cigar.

561
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,300
Wake up, you!

562
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:01,135
The troops are coming!

563
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,221
Blue or gray?

564
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:14,315
They're gray like us. Let's say "hello"
to them and then get going.

565
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:17,652
Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!

566
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,779
Down with General Grant!

567
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:22,782
Hurrah for General... what's his name?

568
01:18:22,824 --> 01:18:23,866
Lee!

569
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:30,206
God is with us because He hates the Yanks, too!

570
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:35,753
God is not on our side 'cause He hates idiots also.

571
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,233
Prisoners of war...

572
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,026
forward...

573
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,112
...march!

574
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:06,177
Form a single file.

575
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,572
Robert Clark.

576
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:08,906
Present.

577
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:11,117
Sam Richmond.

578
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,410
Present.

579
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:16,998
Bill Carson.

580
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:25,298
I said Bill Carson!

581
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:29,010
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

582
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,763
All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!

583
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,811
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.

584
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,232
That's me!

585
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:53,701
Please, Carson.

586
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:56,621
Answer, "Present"!

587
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,416
What are you, deaf'?

588
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:09,050
Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.

589
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:13,387
I like big fat men like you.

590
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,848
When they fall, they make more noise.

591
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,476
And sometimes they never get up.

592
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,270
Wallace...

593
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:24,523
...that's enough.

594
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,986
Sergeant!

595
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,532
The captain wants to see you right away.

596
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:39,288
Be sure these two get good treatment.

597
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:53,010
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that? Good treatment!

598
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:02,436
For the last time, sergeant...

599
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:03,604
...I'm telling you...

600
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:06,732
...I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.

601
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,276
No more brutality!

602
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:14,198
There's hundreds of prisoners out there
and only a few men to guard them.

603
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:16,617
What am I supposed to do? I have to have respect!

604
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:21,497
I think that you'll manage to gain
their respect by treating them better!

605
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:25,459
Are our men treated that well in Andersonville Camp?

606
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:28,337
I don't give a goddamn what they do in Andersonville!

607
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:30,715
While I'm in charge here,
the prisoners are not to be...

608
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:31,924
tortured...

609
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:33,676
...or cheated...

610
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:35,594
...or murdered!

611
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,680
Is that an accusation?

612
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,100
Sergeant, gangrene is eating my leg away...

613
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,519
...not my eyes.

614
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,689
I know the prisoners here are being
robbed systematically.

615
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:50,609
I know there's scum around,
or bivouacked near the camp, waiting...

616
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,571
...for someone to deliver this loot.

617
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:57,408
But as long as I'm commandant,
I won't permit any such trickery!

618
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:59,035
Am I clear?

619
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,163
Yes, sir.

620
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:05,416
Just as long as you're the commandant.

621
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,044
Yes, sergeant.

622
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:14,258
I know this leg means I won't last very long...

623
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,219
...but I pray I can manage to have enough time...

624
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:22,266
...to amass evidence and bring to a
court-martial all those who discredit...

625
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,561
...and dishonor the uniform...

626
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,521
...of the Union!

627
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,444
I wish you luck.

628
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:10,940
You and the others better lay low for a few days.

629
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:15,820
I'll keep this. You go. Wallace will let you know.

630
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:30,709
- Bring me Carson.
- Right.

631
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:48,269
Angel Eyes said for us to lay low for a few days.

632
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:51,605
But we'll keep close enough to keep an eye on things.

633
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:53,941
Come on, saddle your horses.

634
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,036
Come on in, Tuco.

635
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,289
Don't be bashful.

636
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:11,500
There's no formalities here.

637
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,763
It's been a long time!

638
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:29,602
You're hungry.

639
01:26:30,603 --> 01:26:32,271
Sit down. Eat!

640
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,500
I knew it, I knew it!

641
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:57,504
The minute I saw you, I said to myself:

642
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:01,050
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes..."

643
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:04,929
"...I'll bet he's got himself an easy job!"

644
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,267
"And he never forgets a friend!"

645
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,270
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

646
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:19,193
It's good to see old friends again.

647
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:25,157
Especially when they come from so far away...

648
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:28,202
...and have so much to talk about.

649
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:32,581
And you do have a lot to talk about, haven't you?

650
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:36,835
You were captured near...

651
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:38,254
...Fort Craig?

652
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:45,844
If you were with Sibley, then you were...

653
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,472
...coming from Santa Fe?

654
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:02,945
Was it hard crossing the desert?

655
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:04,822
Very hard!

656
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:09,285
Especially if you don't have anything to drink.

657
01:28:11,996 --> 01:28:14,915
Why are you going under the name of Bill Carson, now?

658
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,923
One name is as good as another.

659
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:25,384
Not wise to use your own name.

660
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:29,805
Like you, I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.

661
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,766
Sergeant Angel Eyes.

662
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,111
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

663
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:45,946
Music?

664
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:49,575
Yes, very good for the digestion.

665
01:29:05,132 --> 01:29:07,217
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

666
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:14,808
That fake, too'?

667
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,021
Bill Carson's name is written on it.

668
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,066
Have some.

669
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,943
It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

670
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:51,655
Was Carson dead or alive when you found him?

671
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,247
What'd he tell you about the money?

672
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:06,545
I don't know what you're talking about!

673
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,315
More feeling.

674
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:47,878
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

675
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:51,298
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

676
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:54,092
So many of us have had a session in there.

677
01:32:15,656 --> 01:32:17,658
How's your digestion now?

678
01:32:21,662 --> 01:32:23,205
You'd better talk.

679
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:25,707
I have nothing to tell you!

680
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,070
Play that fiddle, you!

681
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,783
I'll talk!

682
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:53,920
What did he say about the money?

683
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,427
It's buried in a grave.

684
01:34:01,595 --> 01:34:02,679
Where?

685
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,643
At the Sad Hill Cemetery.

686
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,688
Which grave'?

687
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,523
I don't know!

688
01:34:17,486 --> 01:34:18,820
Blondie...

689
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,284
...he knows the name of the grave.

690
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:42,386
The war's over for you.

691
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,766
Put those clothes on.

692
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:53,647
Why?

693
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,941
We're going for a ride.

694
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:57,776
Where?

695
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:00,445
To find $200,000.

696
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:03,740
I know the name of the cemetery now...

697
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:06,952
...and you know the name of the grave.

698
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:29,975
You're not going to give me the same treatment?

699
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:35,063
Would you talk?

700
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,525
No, probably not.

701
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,695
That's what I thought.

702
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,406
Not that you are any tougher than Tuco...

703
01:35:44,865 --> 01:35:47,909
...but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

704
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:54,875
And Tuco, is he?

705
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:59,254
No, not yet...

706
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:02,507
...but he's in very good hands.

707
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:07,012
You changed partners,
but you still got the same deal.

708
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,931
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

709
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:12,684
There's two of us.

710
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:15,562
It should make it easier than just one.

711
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:43,715
Hold it. That's it.

712
01:36:44,257 --> 01:36:45,383
Don't move.

713
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:47,844
Don't breathe.

714
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,266
Got it. Thank you.

715
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:12,786
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost'?
Where's the Rebel going?

716
01:37:13,078 --> 01:37:15,747
To hell with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

717
01:37:15,789 --> 01:37:18,291
Yeah, $3,000, friend.

718
01:37:18,834 --> 01:37:20,919
That's a lot of money for a head.

719
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:25,006
I bet they didn't even pay you a penny for your arm.

720
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:34,391
I told you once, but if I ever get you down...

721
01:37:34,933 --> 01:37:37,394
...you're gonna need a lot of help to get up again.

722
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:59,916
You're a lot luckier than that one there.

723
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,586
You get some proper rope, and you're all finished.

724
01:38:02,669 --> 01:38:05,672
And there isn't any partner, this time,
to shoot you down.

725
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:31,573
Get up!

726
01:39:57,951 --> 01:40:00,453
Sure would like to put your paw on it, huh?

727
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,708
I would like to piss, it's rough.

728
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:07,502
I've been shaken up in this train
nearly ten hours now.

729
01:40:07,544 --> 01:40:09,629
You smell like a pig already!

730
01:40:10,463 --> 01:40:12,966
Let's try not to make things any worse.

731
01:40:15,385 --> 01:40:16,803
Get goin'

732
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:28,773
I can't while you're watching me.

733
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,799
You made a lot of noise my friend, huh?

734
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:17,655
You don't wanna break our friendship, huh?

735
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:19,240
Well, I'll break it!

736
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:43,760
Clemens, take care of the horses.

737
01:48:00,266 --> 01:48:02,894
I've been looking for you for eight months!

738
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:06,814
Whenever I should have had a gun in my right hand...

739
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:08,274
...I thought of you!

740
01:48:08,608 --> 01:48:11,777
Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me.

741
01:48:12,612 --> 01:48:16,532
I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

742
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:34,675
When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk.

743
01:48:38,554 --> 01:48:41,182
Every gun makes its own tune...

744
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:43,976
...and it's perfect timing, large one.

745
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:04,705
Clem, follow him.

746
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:04,056
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

747
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:07,935
Just give me a little time to get dressed,
and I'll open up.

748
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:31,542
Put your drawers on, and take your gun off.

749
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:47,391
How the hell did you get out of that pigsty?

750
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:52,730
My own way. I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.

751
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:56,692
You talked, you traitor! You talked!

752
01:50:57,652 --> 01:50:59,278
No, I didn't talk.

753
01:50:59,862 --> 01:51:02,531
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here, now.

754
01:51:06,744 --> 01:51:09,080
So, only you know your half of the secret?

755
01:51:16,337 --> 01:51:18,589
I'm very happy you are working with me!

756
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:20,341
And we're together again.

757
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:23,177
I'll get dressed, I kill him, and be right back.

758
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:25,888
Listen, I forgot to mention.

759
01:51:28,724 --> 01:51:31,310
He's not alone. There's five of 'em.

760
01:51:33,771 --> 01:51:35,981
- Five?
- Yeah, five of 'em.

761
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:41,570
So, that's why you came to Tuco.

762
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:47,743
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all!

763
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:01,465
They shot him at close range.

764
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:22,862
Well, look who's here!

765
01:52:23,446 --> 01:52:25,156
The other one will be along.

766
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:30,035
They'll come looking for us.

767
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:32,997
Watch out!

768
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:35,875
There's two of them.

769
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:39,420
I want that blond alive!

770
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:51,307
You back there. Come on, let's go!

771
01:53:25,633 --> 01:53:27,760
Were you going to die alone?

772
01:55:46,148 --> 01:55:47,608
Angel Eyes is mine.

773
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:49,360
All right.

774
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:30,943
"See you soon."

775
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:34,571
"Idiots."

776
01:56:36,407 --> 01:56:37,616
It's for you.

777
01:57:02,683 --> 01:57:04,852
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

778
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:08,022
Like a cemetery, for instance?

779
01:57:09,523 --> 01:57:11,817
There should be a bridge across that river.

780
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:14,153
We better wait for nightfall.

781
01:57:14,194 --> 01:57:15,863
Trust in me, Blondie.

782
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:21,076
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

783
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:24,079
Tuco has taken you this far,
I will take you all the way...

784
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:31,962
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

785
01:57:33,338 --> 01:57:35,799
Come along now. Follow me.

786
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,890
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

787
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:41,281
Where do you hail from?

788
01:58:41,824 --> 01:58:43,158
Illinois.

789
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:46,912
And you?

790
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:55,586
I'm with him.

791
01:58:55,587 --> 01:58:57,673
Your reason for being around here?

792
01:58:58,799 --> 01:59:01,260
We want to enlist, general!

793
01:59:04,263 --> 01:59:06,431
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

794
01:59:06,807 --> 01:59:08,183
I'm a captain!

795
01:59:10,144 --> 01:59:11,562
Get the hell out!

796
01:59:13,438 --> 01:59:16,650
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

797
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,992
So, you want to enlist.

798
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:28,287
You got to take a test to prove it.

799
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,339
Well, show me.

800
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:07,492
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel!

801
02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:09,161
- Really?
- Sure!

802
02:00:10,495 --> 02:00:12,206
Like it says in the manual.

803
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:16,960
You've got every qualification
to become expert in the use of weapons.

804
02:00:18,337 --> 02:00:22,049
This is the most potent weapon in war!

805
02:00:25,302 --> 02:00:27,429
The fighting spirit is in this bottle!

806
02:00:29,765 --> 02:00:31,350
Volunteers...

807
02:00:33,477 --> 02:00:35,437
You want to enlist?

808
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:37,814
Then let's go.

809
02:00:42,903 --> 02:00:45,072
The shooting hasn't begun yet.

810
02:00:46,281 --> 02:00:50,160
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

811
02:00:52,204 --> 02:00:55,582
- We have two attacks a day.
- Two attacks a day?

812
02:00:55,916 --> 02:00:56,875
Sure.

813
02:00:57,042 --> 02:01:00,963
The Reb's have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

814
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:04,925
Stupid, useless bridge.

815
02:01:05,676 --> 02:01:08,220
A flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

816
02:01:10,055 --> 02:01:14,685
And headquarters has declared that
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...

817
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:18,230
...even if all of us are killed.

818
02:01:18,647 --> 02:01:22,734
Otherwise, the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

819
02:01:24,403 --> 02:01:25,737
And that's not all.

820
02:01:26,405 --> 02:01:28,782
Both sides want the bridge intact!

821
02:01:29,074 --> 02:01:33,078
Intact is how the South wants it.
And we want it intact, too.

822
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:39,876
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys...

823
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:43,630
...Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

824
02:01:45,007 --> 02:01:46,091
Is it bad...

825
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:48,885
...to speak the way I do to volunteers?

826
02:01:50,345 --> 02:01:52,264
I've done a lot worse.

827
02:01:56,852 --> 02:01:58,895
I've done it. I've blown it up...

828
02:02:01,481 --> 02:02:04,735
...in here. I've destroyed it all.

829
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:08,989
It's a court-martial offense to imagine--
to dream of blowing it up.

830
02:02:09,031 --> 02:02:10,741
A serious crime.

831
02:02:11,116 --> 02:02:14,786
Even to think of destroying that bridge is just...

832
02:02:18,123 --> 02:02:20,417
Why not really blow it up, captain?

833
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:25,380
Yeah, captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them!

834
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,927
I've been dreaming about it.

835
02:02:34,598 --> 02:02:36,641
I've even worked out a plan.

836
02:02:38,268 --> 02:02:39,811
I sure have!

837
02:02:40,896 --> 02:02:43,690
The best time is after the attack...

838
02:02:44,191 --> 02:02:46,943
...when there's a truce to get the wounded.

839
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:49,321
If I could do it...

840
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:52,324
...I could save many thousands of men.

841
02:02:58,413 --> 02:03:00,332
But what I lack is the guts.

842
02:03:06,546 --> 02:03:09,466
They're beginning the daily slaughter, right on time.

843
02:03:09,841 --> 02:03:12,552
Captain! All companies are awaiting your orders.

844
02:03:13,345 --> 02:03:14,930
I'll be right there.

845
02:03:30,695 --> 02:03:31,988
All right, friends...

846
02:03:32,614 --> 02:03:34,783
...come along and enjoy the spectacle.

847
02:04:06,231 --> 02:04:07,274
Companies!

848
02:04:07,691 --> 02:04:08,733
Report!

849
02:04:09,025 --> 02:04:11,236
<i>(Company B, read)”</i>

850
02:04:48,356 --> 02:04:51,943
It looks like the captain is really asking
for a bullet in his guts!

851
02:05:45,789 --> 02:05:49,084
I've never seen so many men wasted so badly.

852
02:06:09,688 --> 02:06:13,233
I've a feeling it's really gonna be
a good long battle.

853
02:06:19,698 --> 02:06:22,075
The money is on the other side of the river.

854
02:06:23,743 --> 02:06:24,703
Where?

855
02:06:27,539 --> 02:06:30,542
Amigo, I said on the other side. That's enough.

856
02:06:31,626 --> 02:06:34,671
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

857
02:06:36,381 --> 02:06:40,385
What would happen
if somebody were to blow up that bridge?

858
02:06:44,014 --> 02:06:46,725
Then these idiots would go somewhere else to fight!

859
02:06:47,559 --> 02:06:48,685
Maybe.

860
02:07:26,806 --> 02:07:29,601
Doctor, quick! The captain's wounded!

861
02:07:32,103 --> 02:07:33,897
Hurry, a stretcher!

862
02:07:36,274 --> 02:07:37,942
Easy, now.

863
02:07:48,828 --> 02:07:50,455
Get things ready.

864
02:08:11,476 --> 02:08:12,977
A little of this will help.

865
02:08:19,901 --> 02:08:21,820
Take a slug of this, captain...

866
02:08:22,362 --> 02:08:24,364
...and keep your ears open.

867
02:09:13,163 --> 02:09:14,247
What're you doing?

868
02:10:56,975 --> 02:10:59,853
You realize we might be risking our lives?

869
02:11:01,396 --> 02:11:05,358
If I get killed, you'll never get your hands
on all that beautiful money.

870
02:11:08,570 --> 02:11:10,488
It sure would be a pity.

871
02:11:46,316 --> 02:11:48,443
Can you help me live a little more?

872
02:11:49,152 --> 02:11:50,904
I expect good news.

873
02:12:04,208 --> 02:12:07,045
Why don't we tell each other our half of the secret?

874
02:12:07,545 --> 02:12:09,505
Why don't we?

875
02:12:11,049 --> 02:12:12,342
You go first.

876
02:12:14,677 --> 02:12:17,180
No, I think it's better that...

877
02:12:19,641 --> 02:12:20,975
...you start.

878
02:12:25,229 --> 02:12:26,230
All right.

879
02:12:29,025 --> 02:12:31,402
The name of the cemetery is...

880
02:12:49,295 --> 02:12:51,422
...Sad Hill! Now it's your turn!

881
02:12:59,764 --> 02:13:01,557
The name on the grave is...

882
02:13:06,270 --> 02:13:07,605
...Arch Stanton.

883
02:13:09,857 --> 02:13:10,942
Arch Stanton?

884
02:13:11,651 --> 02:13:12,944
Are you sure'?

885
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:15,780
Sure, I'm sure.

886
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:03,153
It'd be a lot easier with that.

887
02:25:43,736 --> 02:25:45,946
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

888
02:25:46,613 --> 02:25:47,698
Dig!

889
02:25:50,826 --> 02:25:52,453
You're not digging?

890
02:26:04,715 --> 02:26:07,426
If you shoot me, you won't see a cent of that money.

891
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:11,096
Why?

892
02:26:14,224 --> 02:26:15,601
I'll tell you why.

893
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:18,479
'Cause there's nothin' in there.

894
02:26:28,906 --> 02:26:30,657
You thought I'd trust you?

895
02:26:33,911 --> 02:26:36,288
$200,000 is a lot of money.

896
02:26:37,956 --> 02:26:39,708
We're gonna have to earn it.

897
02:26:43,462 --> 02:26:44,171
How?

898
02:26:56,016 --> 02:26:58,560
I'll write the name on the bottom of this stone.

899
02:27:02,731 --> 02:27:03,690
The gun?

900
02:33:10,473 --> 02:33:14,561
You pig! You wanted to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?

901
02:33:16,646 --> 02:33:17,772
Last night.

902
02:33:19,107 --> 02:33:22,652
You see, in this world there's two kinds
of people, my friend...

903
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:27,449
...those with loaded guns, and those who dig.

904
02:33:28,575 --> 02:33:29,743
You dig.

905
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:31,244
Where?

906
02:33:42,505 --> 02:33:43,506
Here.

907
02:33:48,053 --> 02:33:49,512
There's no name on it!

908
02:33:51,181 --> 02:33:53,099
There's no name here, either.

909
02:33:54,935 --> 02:33:57,646
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me:

910
02:33:57,896 --> 02:34:01,650
"There's a grave marked 'unknown',
right beside Arch Stanton."

911
02:34:09,699 --> 02:34:10,825
Go ahead.

912
02:35:08,842 --> 02:35:11,386
It's money! It's all ours, Blondie!

913
02:35:28,528 --> 02:35:32,991
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
you wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

914
02:35:33,867 --> 02:35:35,869
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

915
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:40,290
I want you to stand up there,
and put your head in that noose.

916
02:36:47,690 --> 02:36:48,858
Well, now...

917
02:36:49,776 --> 02:36:52,028
...seems just like old times.

918
02:36:56,366 --> 02:36:57,867
Four for you...

919
02:37:04,624 --> 02:37:05,875
...and four for me.

920
02:37:48,710 --> 02:37:50,003
Sorry, Tuco.

921
02:40:26,618 --> 02:40:28,578
Hey, Blondie...

922
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:33,291
...you know what you are?

923
02:40:37,086 --> 02:40:39,839
Just a dirty son of a...!
