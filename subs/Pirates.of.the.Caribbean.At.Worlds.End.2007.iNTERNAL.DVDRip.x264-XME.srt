"In order to affect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions,

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,469
and to ensure the common good,

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,758
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

4
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,355
by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,

5
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,478
duly appointed representative
of his Majesty, the King.

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,439
By decree, according to martial law,

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,797
the following statutes
are temporarily amended:

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,475
Right to assembly, suspended.

9
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,153
Right to habeas corpus, suspended.

10
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,633
Right to legal counsel, suspended.

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,680
Right to verdict by a jury of peers,
suspended.

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,796
By decree, all persons
found guilty of piracy,

13
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,873
or aiding a person convicted of piracy,

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,715
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy...

15
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,356
shall be sentenced to
hang by the neck until dead."

16
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,751
<i>The King and his men.</i>

17
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,312
<i>Stole the Queen from her bed.</i>

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,672
<i>And bound her in her bones.</i>

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,798
<i>The seas be ours.</i>

20
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>And by the powers.</i>

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,919
<i>Where we will, we'll roam.</i>

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,838
<i>Yo ho.</i>

23
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,632
<i>All hands.</i>

24
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,434
<i>Hoist the colours high.</i>

25
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,278
<i>Heave-ho.</i>

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,590
<i>Thieves and beggars.</i>

27
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,713
<i>Never shall we die.</i>

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,351
<i>Yo ho.</i>

29
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,990
<i>Haul together.</i>

30
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,117
<i>Hoist the colours high.</i>

31
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,316
Lord Beckett!

32
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,440
They've started to sing, sir.

33
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,999
Finally.
<i>- Thieves and beggars.</i>

34
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,078
<i>Never shall we die.</i>

35
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,274
<i>Some have died and some are alive.</i>

36
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,477
<i>Others sail on the sea.</i>

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,310
<i>With the keys to the cage.</i>

38
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,631
<i>And the devil to pay.</i>

39
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,595
<i>We lay to Fiddler's Green.</i>

40
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,356
<i>The bell has been raised
from its watery grave.</i>

41
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,958
<i>Hear its sepulchral tone.</i>

42
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,911
<i>A call to all
Pay heed the squall.</i>

43
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,351
<i>Turn your sails to home.</i>

44
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,357
<i>Yo ho.</i>

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,912
<i>Haul together.</i>

46
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,392
<i>Hoist the colours high.</i>

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,356
<i>Heave-ho.</i>

48
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,477
<i>Thieve...</i>
- Thief and beggar.

49
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,758
<i>Never shall we die.</i>

50
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,914
A dangerous song to be singing...

51
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,760
for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.

52
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,152
Particularly a woman.

53
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,911
Particularly a woman alone.

54
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,797
What makes you think she's alone?

55
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,634
You protect her?

56
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,870
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

57
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,431
Your master's expecting us.

58
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,673
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.

59
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,594
Pick those feet up!

60
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,119
On the double!

61
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,233
Eyes front!

62
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,313
No, no, no. None.

63
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,840
It always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.

64
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,991
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.

65
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Steady as she goes.

66
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
All right.

67
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,638
Have you heard anything from Will?

68
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,996
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts,

69
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,596
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

70
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,558
Is he that terrifying?

71
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,396
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

72
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,190
We're through. Make ready.

73
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,710
Hurry now.

74
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,510
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

75
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,717
Well, when you put it that way...

76
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,079
Remove. Please.

77
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,033
Remove. Please.

78
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,519
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.

79
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,990
More steam.

80
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
None of that.

81
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,429
If things don't go the way we want, then
we're the only chance they've got.

82
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,872
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.

83
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,873
More of a proposal to put to ye.

84
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,480
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

85
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,071
It's an odd coincidence.

86
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,119
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

87
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,476
No.

88
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,075
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

89
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,949
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

90
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,993
and tried to make off with these.

91
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,155
The navigational charts.

92
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,356
The route to the Farthest Gate.

93
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,039
Wouldn't it be amazing
if this venture of yours

94
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,352
took you to the world beyond this one?

95
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,194
It would strain credulity at that.

96
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,157
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?

97
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,157
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

98
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
No, no!

99
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,711
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

100
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,877
I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

101
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,118
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

102
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,431
But I cannot help but wonder...

103
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,360
Why?

104
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,756
The song has been sung.

105
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,912
The time is upon us.

106
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,996
We must convene the Brethren Court.

107
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,838
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honour the call.

108
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,710
More steam.

109
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,880
More steam!

110
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,037
There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

111
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,918
It is true.

112
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,152
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

113
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,633
is by betraying other pirates.

114
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,393
We must put our differences aside.
- Wait for the signal.

115
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,518
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

116
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,038
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

117
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,394
Against East India Trading Company,
what value is the Brethren Court?

118
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,793
What can any of us do?

119
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,600
You can fight!
- Get off me!

120
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,957
You are Sao Feng,
the Pirate Lord of Singapore.

121
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,557
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

122
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,317
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

123
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,596
and those who pass the test
become legend.

124
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,874
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

125
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,960
The most notorious pirates
from around the world

126
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,952
are uniting against our enemy,

127
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,999
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

128
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,998
Elizabeth Swann.

129
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,070
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

130
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,635
And the eye does not go wanting.

131
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,235
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

132
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,797
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

133
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,996
Jack Sparrow.

134
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,912
He's one of the pirate lords.

135
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,995
The only reason...

136
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,795
I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

137
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,678
is so I can send him back myself!

138
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,000
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

139
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,391
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

140
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
So we must go and get him back.

141
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,232
So you admit...

142
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,711
you have deceived me.

143
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,075
Weapons!

144
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,350
Weapons.

145
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,789
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honourable.

146
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,394
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!

147
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,479
Kill him. He's not our man.

148
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,234
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...

149
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,712
who's he with?

150
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,076
Charge!

151
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Will!

152
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,275
Look out! Look behind you!

153
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,349
Ready!

154
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Fire.

155
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Chart!

156
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Boo!

157
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Company!

158
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,391
Make ready. Set. Fire!

159
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Company!

160
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,037
Make ready. Set.

161
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,990
Fire!

162
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,510
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

163
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,311
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

164
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
It is coincidence only.

165
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,070
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

166
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,553
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

167
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
Why should I expect any better?

168
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,354
I need the <i>Black Pearl</i>
to free my father.

169
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,073
You're helping me to get it.

170
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
Fire in the hole.

171
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,355
Thank you, Jack.

172
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,394
Thank you, Jack.

173
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,234
You have the charts?
- And better yet.

174
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,480
A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

175
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,280
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

176
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,113
This way. Be quick.

177
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,795
Haul the snotters with a will!

178
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,519
Keep it taut.

179
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,399
Secure provisions and stow the cargo.

180
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,154
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

181
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,996
Do you think he will honour the call?

182
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,438
I cannot say.

183
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,431
There's an evil on these seas

184
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,640
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

185
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,394
A piece of eight.

186
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,753
Nine of them, you say.

187
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,799
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

188
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,394
Nine pieces of eight.

189
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,915
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

190
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,231
Nothing can hold against the armada.

191
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,437
Not with the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
at the lead.

192
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,000
Nothing we know of.

193
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,518
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

194
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
He was mum on that, sir.

195
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,030
Then he knows the value of information.

196
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,794
Better keep this between ourselves.

197
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,078
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

198
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,360
Admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

199
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,035
Yes. Something for you there.

200
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,352
Your new station deserves an old friend.

201
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,752
Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

202
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,354
Execution.

203
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,117
The Brethren know they face extinction.

204
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,279
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

205
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,078
No one said anything about cold.

206
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,790
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

207
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,559
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

208
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,998
she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

209
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,280
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

210
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,310
to a place not of death, but punishment.

211
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,076
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

212
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,631
stretching on forever.

213
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,397
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

214
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,639
I knew there was a good reason.

215
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,351
Nothing here is set.

216
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,876
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

217
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,111
But it leads to more places.

218
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,394
"Over the edge.

219
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,790
Over again."

220
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,155
"Sunrise sets.

221
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,119
Flash of green."

222
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,795
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

223
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,237
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

224
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,678
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

225
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,356
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

226
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,639
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

227
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,394
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

228
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,474
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

229
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,317
Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

230
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,598
It's not getting to the
land of the dead that's the problem.

231
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,433
It's getting back.

232
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,118
Bosun! Head to wind! Lift the sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

233
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,153
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

234
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,438
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

235
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,752
Fetch the chest.

236
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,511
And the governor?

237
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,870
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

238
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,153
Does he know?

239
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,116
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

240
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,832
Step lively, men.

241
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,760
Step lively!

242
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,870
Stand fast!

243
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,959
Steady, men.

244
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,112
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

245
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,034
I will not have it on my ship!

246
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,477
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
because I will.

247
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,314
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

248
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,677
that this ship do as directed
by the Company.

249
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,956
We need prisoners to interrogate,

250
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,112
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

251
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,910
The <i>Dutchman</i> sails
as its captain commands.

252
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,755
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

253
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,200
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

254
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,670
This is no longer your world, Jones.

255
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,712
The immaterial has become...

256
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,439
immaterial.

257
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,512
Charge your bayonets.

258
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,196
How long do we continue not talking?

259
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,475
Once we rescue Jack
everything'll be fine.

260
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,794
Then we rescue Jack.

261
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,152
For what we want most...

262
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,232
there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

263
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,796
Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

264
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,155
Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

265
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,152
to find a place as can't be found.

266
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,516
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

267
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,116
We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

268
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,639
To stations!

269
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,080
All hands to stations!

270
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,599
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

271
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,311
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

272
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,275
Blimey.

273
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,952
You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

274
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,600
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

275
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,356
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

276
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,115
Tie her off.

277
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,199
Hard aport.

278
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,473
Hold on!

279
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,554
<i>Strike your colours,
you blooming cockroaches.</i>

280
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:24,954
<i>Dead men tell no tales.</i>

281
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,514
My peanut.

282
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,037
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

283
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,316
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

284
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,437
Step lively with a will.

285
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,034
Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.

286
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,759
I want a fire down below!

287
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,316
Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

288
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,075
Haul!

289
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,274
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalise the lateens.

290
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,079
Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

291
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,398
Mr Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

292
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,834
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

293
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,672
It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

294
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,549
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

295
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,871
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

296
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,351
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

297
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,830
Shall I?

298
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,359
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

299
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,720
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

300
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,840
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

301
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,639
Do you understand?

302
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,713
Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

303
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,312
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

304
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,756
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

305
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,151
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

306
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,039
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

307
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,919
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

308
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,435
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

309
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,914
No wind.

310
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,278
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

311
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,196
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

312
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,911
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

313
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,550
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

314
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,279
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

315
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,876
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

316
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,954
Shoo.

317
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,395
A rock.

318
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,037
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

319
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,200
A rope.

320
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,113
This truly is a godforsaken place.

321
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,799
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

322
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,639
He's here.

323
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,838
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

324
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,320
And does it matter?

325
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,313
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

326
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,276
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

327
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,760
Impossible.

328
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
Boat.

329
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,995
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

330
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,355
It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

331
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,476
Hide the rum.

332
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,392
Mr Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

333
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,755
I thought so.

334
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,639
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

335
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Sir?

336
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,680
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

337
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,911
Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

338
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,394
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

339
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,112
I know that.
I know where I am.

340
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,274
And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

341
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,713
Oh, Hector.

342
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,632
It's been too long. Hasn't it?

343
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,317
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

344
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,478
No, I didn't.

345
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,552
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

346
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,350
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

347
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,472
He thinks we're a hallucination.

348
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,874
William, tell me something:

349
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,840
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

350
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,311
or rather,
damsel in distress? Either one.

351
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
No.

352
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,190
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

353
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,115
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

354
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,475
Jack.

355
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,438
This is real. We're here.

356
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,520
The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

357
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,156
We've come to rescue you.

358
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,031
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

359
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,318
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

360
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,400
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

361
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,591
I see my ship. Right there.

362
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,394
Can't spot it.

363
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,678
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the <i>Pearl.</i>

364
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,434
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

365
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,718
He controls the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>
- He's taking over the seas.

366
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,599
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

367
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,310
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

368
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,869
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

369
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,713
And you need a crew.

370
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,751
Why should I sail with any of you?

371
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,231
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

372
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,077
Oh, she's not told you.

373
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,880
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

374
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,600
As for you.

375
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,432
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

376
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,352
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

377
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,272
Don't need you. You scare me.

378
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,591
Gibbs, you can come. Marty.

379
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Cotton.

380
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,113
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

381
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,435
Who are you?

382
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,751
Tai Huang. These are my men.

383
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,076
Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

384
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,996
I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

385
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,915
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

386
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,150
Weigh anchor.

387
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,114
Jack...

388
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,871
Which way are you going, Jack?

389
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,072
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

390
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,595
Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

391
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,034
What are you doing?

392
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,555
What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

393
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,280
What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

394
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,750
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

395
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,911
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

396
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,314
My ship makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

397
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,790
That makes you "Chartman."

398
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,591
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

399
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,238
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

400
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,154
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

401
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,435
Sorry.

402
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,196
I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

403
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,913
You left Jack to the Kraken.

404
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,997
He's rescued now. It's done with.

405
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,912
Will, I had no choice.

406
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,878
You chose not to tell me.

407
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,439
I couldn't.

408
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,279
It wasn't your burden to bear.

409
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,993
But I did bear it, didn't I?

410
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,438
I just didn't know what it was.

411
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,793
I thought...

412
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,832
You thought I loved him.

413
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,676
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

414
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,789
You can't.

415
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,316
Eerie.

416
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,071
That's downright macabre.

417
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,916
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

418
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,517
Be disrespectful, it would.

419
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,196
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

420
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,798
That was the duty
him was charged with...

421
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,715
by the goddess, Calypso.

422
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,156
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

423
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,198
And every 10 years...

424
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,031
him could come ashore...

425
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,119
to be with she
who love him... truly.

426
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,749
But the man has become a monster.

427
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,240
So, he wasn't always... tentacley?

428
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,356
No.

429
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,756
Him was a man...

430
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,752
once.

431
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,757
Now there's boats coming.

432
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,715
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

433
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,789
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

434
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,031
It's best just let them be.

435
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,316
It's my father. We've made it back.

436
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,835
Father! Father, here, look here!

437
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,630
Elizabeth.

438
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,960
We're not back.

439
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Father!

440
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,237
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

441
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,715
No. No.

442
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,319
I think I am.

443
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,278
No, you can't be.

444
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,114
There was this chest, you see.

445
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,396
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

446
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,190
Come aboard.

447
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,953
And a heart.

448
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:23,069
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

449
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,551
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

450
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,519
The <i>Dutchman</i> must have a captain.

451
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,477
Silly thing to die for.

452
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,872
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

453
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,676
Come on.

454
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,794
A touch... of destiny.

455
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,789
Take the line.

456
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,271
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

457
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,033
Father, the line! Take the line!

458
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,911
She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

459
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,119
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

460
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,598
I'll give your love to your mother.

461
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,717
Please, I won't let you go!

462
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,515
Is there a way?

463
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,799
Him at peace.

464
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,394
No water.

465
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,517
Why is all but the rum gone?

466
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,434
Rum's gone too.

467
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,712
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

468
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,510
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

469
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,672
Doomed to roam the reach
between worlds.

470
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,516
Forever.

471
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,389
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

472
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,599
Why doesn't he do something?

473
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,720
Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

474
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,953
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

475
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,792
"Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

476
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,318
Sunrises don't set.

477
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,438
"Up is down."

478
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,910
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

479
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,878
Why are these things never clear?

480
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,634
Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

481
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,550
Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

482
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,633
Come again?
- The <i>Dutchman</i> must have a captain.

483
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,155
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.

484
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,880
Sail the seas for eternity.

485
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,759
I love the sea.
- What about port?

486
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,718
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

487
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,636
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

488
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,437
Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

489
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,831
Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

490
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,151
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

491
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,391
But eternity is longer still.

492
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,999
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

493
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,960
Or not?

494
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,750
The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

495
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,271
Come sunset, it won't matter.

496
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,599
Not sunset.

497
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,910
Sundown.

498
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,275
And rise. Up.

499
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,630
What's that?

500
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,313
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

501
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,039
Where?
- There.

502
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,195
What is it?

503
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,513
He's rocking the ship.

504
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,399
We're rocking the ship.

505
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,114
Aye. He's onto it.

506
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,959
He's rocking the ship.

507
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,271
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

508
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,920
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

509
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,480
Time it with the swell.

510
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,590
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

511
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,756
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

512
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Now up...

513
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,115
is down.

514
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,112
This was your idea.

515
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,030
Blessed sweet westerlies!

516
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,080
We're back!

517
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,989
It's the sunrise.

518
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,480
Parley?

519
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,916
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

520
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,080
All right, then!

521
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,153
The Brethren Court
is agathering at Shipwreck Cove.

522
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,790
And, Jack, you and I are agoing.
There'll be no arguing that point.

523
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,200
I is arguing the point.

524
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,751
If there's pirates agathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

525
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,117
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

526
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,396
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

527
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,359
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

528
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,954
till there be none left but you.

529
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:42,074
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

530
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,160
Aye.

531
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,793
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

532
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,792
I'm still working on that.

533
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,193
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

534
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,915
Wet powder.

535
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,951
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

536
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,315
Sorry. Effective, though.

537
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,277
There's fresh water on this island.

538
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,831
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

539
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,794
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

540
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,590
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

541
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,151
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

542
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,635
Temporarily.

543
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,240
Mind the boat.

544
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,599
Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

545
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,752
Careful! Careful!

546
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,072
You stupid fish!

547
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,078
Actually it's a cephalopod.

548
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,670
Serves you right.

549
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,634
Pin, I bet people would pay
a shilling to see this.

550
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,753
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

551
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,719
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

552
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,520
We could serve up a slice as a souvenir.

553
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,069
Still thinking of running, Jack?

554
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,230
Think you can outrun the world?

555
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,310
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

556
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,995
by and by, there be none left at all.

557
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,151
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

558
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,233
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

559
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,480
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

560
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,475
But passing on, that's dead certain.

561
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,599
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

562
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,319
It's our only hope, lad.

563
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,559
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

564
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,680
The world used to be a bigger place.

565
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,072
The world's still the same.

566
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,594
There's just... less in it.

567
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,191
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

568
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,510
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

569
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,512
Singapore.
- Captain!

570
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,276
Hoy!

571
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,039
We got company!

572
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,719
He's the captain.

573
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,909
Sao Feng...

574
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,313
you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

575
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,599
Jack Sparrow.

576
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,472
You paid me great insult once.

577
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,994
That doesn't sound like me.

578
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,791
Shall we just call it square, then?

579
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,436
Release her.

580
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,876
She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

581
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,632
You heard Captain Turner.

582
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,549
Release her!
- "Captain Turner?"

583
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,280
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

584
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,795
I need the <i>Pearl</i> to free my father.

585
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,270
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

586
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,520
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

587
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,717
It was my burden to bear.

588
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,959
He needs the <i>Pearl.</i>
Captain Turner needs the <i>Pearl.</i>

589
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,954
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

590
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,759
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

591
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,954
I'm standing with them.

592
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:59,479
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

593
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,031
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

594
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,511
Here is your chance to find out.

595
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,119
Curious.

596
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,238
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

597
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,678
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

598
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,632
can defeat the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>

599
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,597
And so despair leads to betrayal.

600
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,795
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

601
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,914
It's not here, Jack.

602
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,600
What? What isn't?

603
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,959
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the <i>Dutchman,</i>

604
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,953
and so unavailable for use as leverage

605
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,600
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

606
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,798
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

607
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,912
By your death?

608
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,957
And yet here you are.

609
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,995
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

610
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,434
That's how I get by.

611
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,791
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

612
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,720
Ship oars.

613
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,314
Ship oars.

614
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,159
Be on your guard, men.

615
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,433
My men are crew enough.

616
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,637
Company ship, company crew.

617
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,439
You agreed.
The <i>Black Pearl</i> was to be mine.

618
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,634
And so it was.

619
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,434
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

620
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:37,640
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

621
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,317
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

622
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,317
Square my debt with Jones...

623
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,078
guarantee my freedom?

624
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,719
Of course.

625
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,632
It's just good business.

626
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,277
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

627
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,431
Everything.

628
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,149
Where are they meeting?

629
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,832
Who are the pirate lords?

630
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,832
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

631
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,478
Prepare the brig.

632
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,717
Beckett agreed the <i>Black Pearl</i>
was to be mine.

633
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,953
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the <i>Dutchman,</i> is he?

634
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,313
Shame they're not bound to honour
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

635
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,518
Because honour's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

636
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,198
There is no honour
to remaining with the losing side.

637
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,638
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

638
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,396
The losing side, you say?
- They have the <i>Dutchman.</i>

639
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,914
Now the <i>Pearl!</i>

640
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,758
And what do the Brethren have?

641
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,353
We have Calypso.

642
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,080
Calypso.

643
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,952
An old legend.

644
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,791
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

645
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:27,269
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

646
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,435
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

647
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,234
All the Court.

648
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,679
You can keep Barbossa.

649
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,635
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

650
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,110
And Turner. Especially Turner.

651
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,511
The rest go with me on the <i>Pearl.</i>
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

652
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,719
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

653
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:58,158
Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

654
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,837
What interest is she to you?

655
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,511
What are you proposing, captain?

656
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,479
What be accepting, cap'n?

657
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,156
The girl.
- What?

658
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,754
Jack.

659
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,073
I've just recalled.

660
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,996
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

661
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,631
So for what do I need you?

662
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,677
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

663
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,717
Out of the question.

664
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,473
It was not a question.

665
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,233
Points to the thing you want most.

666
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,391
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

667
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,598
Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

668
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,557
Dead.
- Done.

669
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,200
What? Not done.

670
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,715
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

671
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,870
Damn.

672
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,510
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

673
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,913
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

674
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,471
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

675
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,199
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

676
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,637
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

677
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,471
Then we have an accord?

678
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,715
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

679
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,838
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

680
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,719
able to withstand blockade for years.

681
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,192
Then you'd be wishing, "If only there
was someone I had not killed inside

682
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,631
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

683
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,278
And you can accomplish all this?

684
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,479
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

685
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,836
Who am I?

686
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,679
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

687
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,476
Done!

688
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,476
Man overboard!

689
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,110
You're mad.

690
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,518
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

691
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,559
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

692
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,312
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

693
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,033
Which ship do we follow?

694
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,592
Signal the <i>Dutchman</i> to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the <i>Pearl.</i>

695
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,955
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

696
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,915
She's going down!

697
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,480
Stand clear!

698
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:34,151
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

699
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Sir.

700
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,318
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

701
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,830
Calypso.

702
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,355
Excuse me?

703
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:34,480
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

704
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,599
but it is what we call you.

705
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,550
We being who?

706
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,839
You confirm it.

707
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,514
Confirm what?

708
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,112
You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

709
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,638
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

710
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,478
They bound you to human form

711
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,871
so the rule of the seas
would belong to Man, and not...

712
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,679
To me.

713
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,757
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

714
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,309
Pretty speech from a captor.

715
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,235
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

716
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,439
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

717
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,394
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

718
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,156
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

719
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,555
I offer simply my desire.

720
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,434
And in return?

721
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,269
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

722
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,949
And if I should choose not?

723
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,312
Then I will take...

724
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,560
your fury.

725
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,595
Sao Feng?

726
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,196
Here.

727
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,960
Please.

728
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,951
With all nine pieces of eight...

729
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,317
you will be free.

730
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,150
Take it!

731
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,718
You are captain now.

732
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,800
Me?

733
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:56,752
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

734
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,229
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

735
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:06,037
Forgive me... Calypso.

736
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,950
Sao.

737
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,479
What did he tell you?

738
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,158
He made me captain.

739
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,471
Set! Fire!

740
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,637
You are not my captain.

741
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,155
Elizabeth.

742
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,514
James. James.

743
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,918
Thank God, you're alive.

744
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,080
Your father'll be overjoyed

745
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,880
to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

746
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,960
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

747
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,752
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

748
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,680
Who among you
do you name as captain?

749
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,194
Captain. Her.

750
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,636
Captain?

751
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,236
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

752
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,398
The captain shall have my quarters.

753
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,280
Thank you, sir.

754
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,956
But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

755
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,474
I swear.

756
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,320
I did not know.

757
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,394
Know what?
Which side you chose?

758
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,753
Well, now you do.

759
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,036
Bootstrap?

760
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,549
Bootstrap.

761
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,235
Bill Turner?

762
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,390
Bootstrap.

763
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,998
You know my name.

764
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,680
Yes, I know your son.

765
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,160
Will Turner.

766
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,590
William.

767
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,590
He made it. He's alive.

768
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,754
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

769
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,916
God's wounds. He's on his way.

770
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,275
Yes, Will is alive.

771
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,160
And he wants to help you.

772
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,871
He can't help me. He won't come.

773
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,114
But you're his father.

774
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,639
I know you.

775
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,920
He spoke of you.

776
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,872
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

777
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,160
Me?

778
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,313
You're Elizabeth.

779
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,040
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

780
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:22,516
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

781
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,834
Captain... Forever.

782
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,394
The <i>Dutchman</i>
must always have a captain.

783
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,072
And if he saves me...

784
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,038
he loses you.

785
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,950
I see.

786
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,638
He won't pick me.

787
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,591
I wouldn't pick me.

788
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,960
Tell him not to come.

789
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,117
Tell him to stay away.

790
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,317
Tell him it's too late.

791
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,991
I'm already a part of the ship...

792
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,514
and the crew.

793
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,560
Bootstrap.

794
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,318
You know my name.

795
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,192
You know my name.

796
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,153
Yes, I know your son.

797
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,759
William.

798
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,153
He's coming for me.

799
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,234
Wait and see.

800
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,595
You'll see.

801
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,633
He promised.

802
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,192
Swing her over.

803
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,079
Ready those lines.

804
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,476
Sir.

805
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,478
A breadcrumb trail.

806
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,713
And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

807
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,750
Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

808
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,789
Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

809
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,711
We can only hope
to reach our destination

810
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,757
before they run out of bodies.

811
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,793
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

812
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,952
William, do you notice anything?

813
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,755
Rather...

814
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,551
do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

815
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,159
You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

816
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,640
Not as odd as this.

817
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,276
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

818
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,273
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

819
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,711
This is what you've arrived at?

820
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,759
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

821
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,839
accomplish your own ends?

822
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,639
It's like you don't know me at all.

823
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,793
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

824
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,395
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

825
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,120
I'm losing her, Jack.

826
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,629
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

827
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,596
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

828
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,152
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

829
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,192
avoid the choice altogether.

830
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,400
Change the facts.

831
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,313
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

832
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,315
Who?

833
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,400
You?

834
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,678
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

835
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,276
I slip aboard the <i>Dutchman,</i> find
the heart, stab the beating thing,

836
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,079
your father's free from his debt,

837
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,720
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

838
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,510
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the <i>Dutchman...</i>

839
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,355
forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

840
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,320
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

841
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,632
You have to do the job though, Jack.

842
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,639
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

843
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,357
Or end up just like Jones.

844
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,632
I don't have the face for tentacles.

845
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,875
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

846
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,836
What's this for?

847
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,515
Think like me. It'll come to you.

848
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,476
My regards to Davy Jones.

849
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,960
I hate him.

850
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,430
Come with me.

851
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,030
Quickly.

852
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,949
What are you doing?

853
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,517
Choosing a side.

854
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,789
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

855
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,111
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

856
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,471
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

857
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,314
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

858
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,319
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

859
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,716
Come with us.

860
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,233
James, come with me.

861
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,232
Who goes there?

862
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,758
Go. I will follow.

863
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,873
You're lying.

864
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,319
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

865
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,040
but never joined.

866
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,919
Go, now.

867
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,711
Back to your station, sailor.

868
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,509
No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

869
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,239
That's an order.

870
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,800
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

871
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,634
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

872
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,360
Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

873
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,750
All hands, prisoner escape!

874
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,231
Belay that!
- James!

875
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,512
Prisoner escape!

876
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,393
James! No!

877
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,794
The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

878
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,837
The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

879
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,355
To the captain's cabin!
- Aye!

880
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,352
Back to the ship.

881
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:15,029
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

882
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,992
I take that as a "no."

883
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,760
Nice sword.

884
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,716
The <i>Dutchman</i> is under my command.

885
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,316
For now.

886
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,238
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

887
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,755
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

888
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,117
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

889
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,510
You heard him. Step lively.

890
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,831
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

891
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,640
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

892
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,870
Aye.

893
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,920
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

894
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,514
What you call him?

895
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:40,835
Larry.

896
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,199
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

897
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,158
But we agreed on ends only.

898
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:52,074
The means are mine to decide.

899
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,550
Caution, Barbossa.

900
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:58,680
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

901
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,436
Or what it mean if you fail me.

902
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,320
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

903
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,996
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

904
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,275
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

905
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,952
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

906
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,157
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

907
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,833
Take this fishwife to the brig.

908
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,671
Right this way, Mrs Fish.

909
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,189
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

910
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,158
Apparently, you can.

911
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,273
I believe you know each other.

912
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,600
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

913
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,000
Not yours.

914
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,550
His.

915
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,477
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

916
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,273
Sparrow?

917
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,194
You didn't tell him.

918
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,398
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the <i>Black Pearl.</i>

919
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,919
What else have you not told me?

920
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:35,475
There is an issue far more troublesome.

921
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:40,231
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

922
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,399
Not a person.

923
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,080
A heathen god.

924
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,511
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams,

925
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,798
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

926
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,873
The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

927
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,229
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

928
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,719
No! They cannot!

929
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,634
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

930
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,554
That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

931
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,835
I showed them how to bind her.

932
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,798
She could not be trusted.

933
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,633
She gave me no choice.

934
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,994
We must act before they release her.

935
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,753
You loved her.

936
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,758
She's the one.

937
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,752
And then you betrayed her.

938
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,470
She pretended to love me.

939
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,156
She betrayed me.

940
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,277
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

941
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,000
Do not test me.

942
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,753
I hadn't finished that.

943
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,717
You will free my father.

944
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,756
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

945
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,354
Along with my own.

946
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,875
Your terms are steep, Mr Turner.

947
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,634
We will expect fair value in return.

948
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,750
There is only one price I will accept:

949
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,799
Calypso murdered.

950
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,871
Calypso's aboard the <i>Black Pearl.</i>

951
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,072
Jack has sailed
the <i>Black Pearl</i> to Shipwreck Cove.

952
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:25,109
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

953
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,949
What is it you want most?

954
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,040
Look at them all.

955
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,080
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

956
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,752
And I owe them all money.

957
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,270
As he who issued summons,

958
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,718
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

959
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:36,951
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

960
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:41,597
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

961
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,478
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

962
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,156
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

963
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:00,393
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

964
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,080
So change the name.

965
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:07,234
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

966
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,552
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

967
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,430
Master Ragetti, if you will.

968
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,079
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

969
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,119
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

970
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,950
Sparrow.

971
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,272
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

972
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:39,149
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

973
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,754
Sao Feng is dead.

974
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,832
He fell to the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>

975
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,116
The plagued ship.

976
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,557
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

977
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,470
Listen. Listen to me.

978
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,677
Our location has been betrayed.

979
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,310
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

980
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,871
Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

981
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,157
Where's Will?
- Not among us.

982
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,835
It matters not how they found us.
The question is:

983
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,310
What will we do now that they have?

984
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,834
We fight.

985
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,037
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

986
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,794
A well supplied fortress.

987
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,990
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

988
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,952
There be a third course.

989
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,470
In another age, at this very spot,

990
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,840
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

991
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,840
That was a mistake.

992
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,440
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

993
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,359
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

994
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,590
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

995
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:58,356
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

996
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:02,593
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

997
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,433
You all know this to be true.

998
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,520
Gentlemen.

999
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,716
Ladies.

1000
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,039
We must free Calypso.

1001
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,990
Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

1002
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,835
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

1003
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,310
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

1004
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,154
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

1005
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,072
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

1006
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,836
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

1007
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,991
You threaten me?
- I silence you.

1008
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,478
This is madness.
- This is politics.

1009
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,029
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

1010
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,589
If they not be here already.

1011
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,556
My sweet.

1012
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,877
You come for me.

1013
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:49,551
You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

1014
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,714
Trapped in this single form.

1015
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,516
Cut off from the sea.

1016
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,429
From all that I love.

1017
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,034
From you.

1018
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:06,993
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

1019
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:13,520
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

1020
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:18,552
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

1021
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:23,278
you weren't there.

1022
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,749
Why weren't you there?

1023
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,599
It's my nature.

1024
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:37,198
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

1025
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,950
I do not love you.

1026
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,876
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

1027
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,957
But never cruel.

1028
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,594
You have corrupted your purpose...

1029
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,389
and so your self.

1030
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,117
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

1031
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:26,113
Calypso.

1032
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,838
I will be free.

1033
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:36,230
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

1034
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,839
And we would be together always.

1035
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,678
If only you had a heart to give.

1036
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,714
Why did you come?

1037
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,795
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

1038
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,072
The Brethren Court?

1039
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:20,557
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

1040
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,235
is how cruel I can be.

1041
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:31,919
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

1042
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:36,717
My heart will always belong to you.

1043
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,150
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1044
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,391
We should be the ones to set her free.

1045
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:59,633
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

1046
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,110
Whose boons? Your boons?

1047
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:05,034
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

1048
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:09,319
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

1049
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,560
Cuttlefish.

1050
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,115
Let us not, dear friends,

1051
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:21,079
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

1052
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,671
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1053
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,515
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

1054
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,829
Human nature, isn't it?

1055
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,832
Or fish nature.

1056
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,470
So, yes. We could hole up here
well provisioned and well armed.

1057
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,631
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

1058
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:40,475
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

1059
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:50,759
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

1060
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,675
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

1061
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,349
I rather doubt it.

1062
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:01,955
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

1063
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,714
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

1064
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,720
We are left with but one option.

1065
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:15,476
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

1066
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,030
Captain Swann. We must fight.

1067
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,672
You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1068
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,796
Have so.
- Have not.

1069
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,956
Have so.
- Have not!

1070
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,152
You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

1071
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:33,280
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1072
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,400
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

1073
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:38,800
We must fight...

1074
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:40,960
to run away.

1075
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,040
Aye!

1076
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,193
As per the Code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1077
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,920
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1078
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,589
You made that up.
- Did I, now?

1079
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:59,038
I call on Cap'n Teague.
Keeper of the Code.

1080
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,277
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

1081
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,230
Hang the Code. Who cares a...

1082
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,713
Code is the law.

1083
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,112
You're in my way, boy.

1084
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,475
The Code.
- The Code.

1085
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,711
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1086
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,795
That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

1087
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,994
Sea turtles.

1088
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,719
Barbossa is right.

1089
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,270
Hang on a minute.

1090
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,558
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

1091
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,951
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."

1092
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,040
Fancy that.

1093
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:37,430
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

1094
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,079
And that's not likely to change.

1095
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,117
Not likely.
- Why not?

1096
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,709
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

1097
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,157
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1098
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,276
I call for a vote.

1099
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,151
I vote for Ammand the Corsair.

1100
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,709
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1101
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,640
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

1102
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,312
Mistress Ching.

1103
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,754
Gentleman Jocard.

1104
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,875
Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

1105
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,633
Vallenueva!

1106
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,720
Elizabeth Swann.

1107
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,598
What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1108
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,599
Vote for me. Vote for me.

1109
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,314
What you talking about?

1110
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:26,956
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the Code, then?

1111
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:36,596
Very well.

1112
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,676
What say you, Captain Swann,
King of the Brethren Court?

1113
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,791
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1114
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,716
At dawn...

1115
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,356
we're at war.

1116
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,477
And so we shall go to war.

1117
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,520
What?

1118
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:18,154
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

1119
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,400
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

1120
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,277
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

1121
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:33,000
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

1122
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,996
How's Mum?

1123
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,080
She looks great.

1124
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:10,111
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

1125
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,870
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

1126
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:44,596
Parley?

1127
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:42,517
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

1128
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:46,594
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

1129
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:51,038
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

1130
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,959
My hands are clean in this.

1131
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,076
Figuratively.

1132
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,916
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1133
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,277
Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1134
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,272
Will, I've been aboard the <i>Dutchman.</i>

1135
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,358
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1136
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:14,870
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

1137
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:21,717
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1138
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:27,596
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

1139
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,558
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

1140
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:35,395
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

1141
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:40,236
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the <i>Dutchman.</i> As a start.

1142
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,952
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1143
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:46,350
You escaped.
- Technically.

1144
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:48,397
I propose an exchange.

1145
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,198
Will leaves with us...

1146
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,599
and you can take Jack.

1147
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,600
Done.

1148
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,839
Undone.
- Done.

1149
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,231
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1150
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,720
King.

1151
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:11,034
As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

1152
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:19,590
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1153
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:24,117
First to the finish, then?

1154
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,955
Do you fear death?

1155
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,159
You've no idea.

1156
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,758
Advise your Brethren:

1157
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,799
You can fight, and all of you will die.

1158
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:02,238
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

1159
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,797
You murdered my father.

1160
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:08,032
He chose his own fate.

1161
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:11,235
And you have chosen yours.

1162
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,312
We will fight.

1163
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,599
And you will die.

1164
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,754
So be it.

1165
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,840
King?

1166
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:31,640
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

1167
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:34,351
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

1168
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,480
Bravo!

1169
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:46,520
You've successfully arrived aboard
the <i>Dutchman</i> as per the overall scheme.

1170
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,193
Look.
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1171
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,239
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1172
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,596
Go away.

1173
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:56,718
What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1174
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,556
Stab the heart.

1175
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:09,076
Live forever as captain
of the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>

1176
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,274
Then again...

1177
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:16,719
if you're in the brig...

1178
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,072
who's to stab the heart?

1179
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,234
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1180
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,513
Peanut.

1181
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,917
We'll need to use the <i>Black Pearl</i>
as a flagship to lead the attack.

1182
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,917
Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs Fish. Come on.

1183
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,757
Barbossa, you can't release her.

1184
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,672
We need to give Jack a chance.

1185
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:46,956
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

1186
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:50,949
No longer.

1187
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,519
The enemy...

1188
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:57,871
has opted for oblivion.

1189
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,439
Ready the fleet.

1190
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,672
To your stations.

1191
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,558
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

1192
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,835
Aye.

1193
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:19,358
The items brought together, done.

1194
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,716
Items to be burned...

1195
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,431
and someone must speak the words:

1196
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,831
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

1197
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:28,920
Is that it?

1198
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:33,116
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1199
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:44,035
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

1200
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:57,149
Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

1201
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,840
He didn't...

1202
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,078
You have to say it right.

1203
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,320
Calypso...

1204
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:21,437
I release you from your human bonds.

1205
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:41,279
Tia Dalma.

1206
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,875
Calypso.

1207
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:51,234
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

1208
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:57,315
Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

1209
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,233
Davy Jones.

1210
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:17,356
This is it! This is it!

1211
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,919
Calypso!

1212
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,950
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

1213
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:13,437
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favour.

1214
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:19,239
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

1215
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:23,919
but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

1216
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,516
or mine.

1217
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Is that it?

1218
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,792
Why, she's no help at all.

1219
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,635
What now?

1220
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,550
Nothing.

1221
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,279
Our final hope has failed us.

1222
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:06,479
It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

1223
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,315
We've an armada against us, and
with the <i>Dutchman,</i> there's no chance.

1224
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,596
There's only a fool's chance.

1225
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:15,320
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1226
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:18,552
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1227
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,754
You're right.

1228
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,798
Then what shall we die for?

1229
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,714
You will listen to me.

1230
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,629
Listen!

1231
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:46,270
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the <i>Black Pearl,</i> to lead.

1232
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,200
And what will they see?

1233
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:51,878
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1234
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:56,000
No, they will see free men and freedom!

1235
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:59,357
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1236
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:04,469
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

1237
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,231
By the sweat of our brows,

1238
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:11,596
and the strength of our backs...

1239
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:14,839
and the courage of our hearts.

1240
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:18,874
Gentlemen...

1241
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,840
hoist the colours.

1242
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,154
Hoist the colours.

1243
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,436
Hoist the colours.
- Hoist the colours!

1244
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,477
Aye.

1245
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:34,076
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

1246
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,992
Hoist the colours!

1247
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,077
We have a favourable wind, sir.

1248
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:30,916
Oh, so we do.

1249
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,394
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1250
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,357
That should brighten his day.

1251
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:44,875
To arms! We give no quarter!

1252
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,513
Calypso.

1253
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,839
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

1254
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:24,920
That's a bad sign.

1255
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,677
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

1256
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,513
Maelstrom!

1257
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,557
Captain Barbossa!

1258
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,397
We need you at the helm.

1259
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,076
Aye, that be true.

1260
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:05,036
Brace up yards,
you cackhanded deck apes.

1261
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:08,995
Dying is the day worth living for.

1262
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,439
Veer off!

1263
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,716
She'll not harm us.

1264
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,431
Full-bore and into the abyss.

1265
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:27,395
Are you mad?

1266
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,279
You afraid to get wet?

1267
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:41,676
She's on our stern and gaining.

1268
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:47,119
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1269
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:56,110
Bow cannons!

1270
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,956
Blow the cannons!

1271
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:12,154
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

1272
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:16,951
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1273
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:20,112
Prepare to broadside.

1274
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:32,271
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

1275
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:36,036
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

1276
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:46,357
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

1277
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,557
Hinges. Hinges.

1278
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,869
Think like the whelp.

1279
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,314
Half-barrel hinges.

1280
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:52,669
Leverage.

1281
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,557
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1282
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,680
I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1283
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,240
Nobody move.

1284
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:07,953
I dropped me brain.

1285
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,114
Batten down the hatches!

1286
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:23,317
Stand to your guns.

1287
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:26,270
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts.

1288
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:32,676
Main battery at the ready!

1289
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:41,114
Hold there!
Wait till we're boardandboard.

1290
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,159
Fire!

1291
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,673
Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

1292
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,716
Fire!

1293
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:58,920
Fire!

1294
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,270
Come on, men.

1295
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:23,552
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1296
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,877
Halt there or we'll shoot.

1297
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,436
Good one.

1298
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,757
I just come to get me effects.

1299
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:42,320
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

1300
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,551
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1301
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:50,352
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

1302
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:51,999
I blame the fish people.

1303
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:56,279
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

1304
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:59,398
automatically aren't
as disciplined as nonfish people?

1305
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,756
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

1306
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:06,517
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1307
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:09,877
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

1308
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,077
Prepare to board!

1309
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:21,790
Cover!

1310
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:39,393
No!

1311
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:09,071
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

1312
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:12,870
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1313
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,833
To my great regret.

1314
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:18,150
But...

1315
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,672
never too late to learn, eh?

1316
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:41,518
The chest, hand it over.

1317
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,319
I can set you free, mate.

1318
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:46,313
My freedom was forfeit long ago.

1319
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,715
Elizabeth.

1320
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:37,510
Elizabeth.

1321
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:39,800
Will you marry me?

1322
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,273
I don't think now's the best time.

1323
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,917
Now may be the only time.

1324
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:55,070
I love you.

1325
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,235
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1326
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:05,269
Barbossa.

1327
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:08,034
Marry us.

1328
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:11,680
I'm a little busy at the moment.

1329
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,518
Barbossa, now.

1330
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,395
Fine, then.

1331
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:35,833
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

1332
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:39,911
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

1333
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:47,473
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1334
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:49,472
I do.
- Great.

1335
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:57,831
Will Turner, do you take me...

1336
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,713
to be your wife...

1337
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,832
in sickness and in health...

1338
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:09,831
with health being the less likely?

1339
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:17,910
I do.

1340
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:22,874
As captain, I now pronounce you...

1341
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:27,319
You may kiss...

1342
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,394
You may kiss...

1343
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:43,753
Just kiss.

1344
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:22,473
Leave it.

1345
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:36,755
You can do nothing without the key.

1346
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,240
I already have the key.

1347
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:40,834
No, you don't.

1348
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:43,555
Oh, that key.

1349
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:19,120
No!

1350
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:47,430
Oi. My pistol.

1351
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,354
Turner.

1352
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:21,120
Fire!

1353
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:28,274
Thank you, Jack.

1354
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,354
Stop! It's me.

1355
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:03,559
It's Will. Your son.

1356
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:03,600
Go!

1357
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:25,120
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

1358
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:27,476
That's why I brought this.

1359
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:49,192
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1360
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:58,715
Missed.

1361
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:04,557
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

1362
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,594
Love.

1363
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:27,317
A dreadful bond.

1364
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:32,831
And yet, so easily severed.

1365
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:37,870
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

1366
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:39,314
Do you?

1367
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:53,190
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

1368
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:57,993
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1369
02:13:58,840 --> 02:14:01,150
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1370
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:03,234
Is it?

1371
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,990
Will?

1372
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:33,035
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

1373
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:40,273
William?

1374
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:42,319
My son.

1375
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:57,031
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

1376
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:04,355
You will not forestall my judgment.

1377
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,113
Calypso.

1378
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:31,954
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

1379
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:02,676
No.

1380
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:08,034
No, no.

1381
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:09,793
No!

1382
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,119
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1383
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:18,511
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1384
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,557
Don't leave me.

1385
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:23,393
Don't. No!

1386
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:25,278
I won't leave you.

1387
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,117
The <i>Dutchman</i> must have a captain.

1388
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:41,280
Hold on.

1389
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,319
Thank goodness, Jack.

1390
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:39,189
The armada's still out there. The
<i>Endeavour's</i> coming up hard to starboard,

1391
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:43,194
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1392
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:45,795
Never actually been one for tradition.

1393
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:53,473
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

1394
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:55,677
Belay that.
Or we'll be a sitting duck.

1395
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:57,035
Belay that "belay that."

1396
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,839
But, the arma...
- Belay.

1397
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:01,116
The <i>Endeav...</i>
- Stow. Shut it.

1398
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:15,558
What are they waiting for?

1399
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:19,354
He expects us to honour our agreement.

1400
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:24,160
Ready guns and gun ports.

1401
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,438
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1402
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,590
Ah, she survived.

1403
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:27,952
Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.

1404
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:30,631
Full canvas.

1405
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:32,996
Aye, full canvas.

1406
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:57,755
Orders, sir.

1407
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:02,150
Sir!

1408
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:03,720
Cap'n.

1409
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:06,675
Fire.
- Fire!

1410
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:08,717
Fire!
- Fire!

1411
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,678
Fire, all!

1412
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:23,599
Orders? Orders, sir?

1413
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:36,880
Sir, what do you command?

1414
02:20:37,480 --> 02:20:38,755
It's just...

1415
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:42,439
good business.

1416
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:45,315
Abandon ship!

1417
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:49,280
Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

1418
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,280
They're turning away!

1419
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,798
Wind in your sails.

1420
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:33,792
Shiver me timbers.

1421
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:55,872
Captain Turner!

1422
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:11,952
Mr Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

1423
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:15,999
You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

1424
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:17,719
Hooray!

1425
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:21,559
Now go and get it.

1426
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:40,714
Orders, sir?

1427
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:48,675
You're no longer bound
to the <i>Dutchman.</i> You're free.

1428
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:50,672
Aye.

1429
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:53,070
That's a fine thing, but...

1430
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:59,117
by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

1431
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:00,714
If you'll have me.

1432
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:06,398
On the wheel, then, Mr Turner.

1433
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:09,632
Aye, Captain Turner.

1434
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:26,480
This ship has a purpose again.

1435
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:28,517
And where we are bound...

1436
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:31,516
she cannot come.

1437
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:33,478
One day ashore.

1438
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:35,552
Ten years at sea.

1439
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:39,200
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

1440
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:43,237
Depends on the one day.

1441
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:48,349
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

1442
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,912
The oars are inside.

1443
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,918
Mrs Turner.

1444
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:13,120
Goodbye, poppet.

1445
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:19,949
Jack.

1446
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:23,555
It would never
have worked out between us.

1447
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:29,159
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1448
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:34,238
Once was quite enough.

1449
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:38,432
Thank you.

1450
02:25:56,960 --> 02:25:58,872
I'm going to need the other one.

1451
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:31,472
It's nearly sunset.

1452
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:51,519
It's always belonged to you.

1453
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,514
Will you keep it safe?

1454
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:01,356
Yes.

1455
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:06,276
Yes.

1456
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:26,360
Will!

1457
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,351
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1458
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:12,912
Granted it tends to list to port,

1459
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,391
and has been, on occasion,
known to frighten young women.

1460
02:28:16,480 --> 02:28:20,679
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

1461
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:22,430
Is that it?

1462
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,480
The <i>Black Pearl?</i>

1463
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:26,309
It's not very big.

1464
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:29,470
Love, that is a dinghy.

1465
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:34,715
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and hugeish and...

1466
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:38,153
gone. Why is it gone?

1467
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,599
Is that it there?

1468
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:42,830
Yes, there it is.

1469
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:44,995
Why is it there?

1470
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:47,794
It's much larger up close.

1471
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:50,111
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

1472
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:53,910
I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

1473
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,515
Not what he said.
- I never!

1474
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:02,200
Mr Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1475
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:05,000
The ship? We're on the ship.

1476
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:10,274
Jack! The ship's gone!

1477
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:11,360
Really?

1478
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:16,438
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1479
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:19,752
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

1480
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:21,240
No, I don't love you.

1481
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:24,392
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1482
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:26,995
It is pronounced "egregious."

1483
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:30,915
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1484
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,560
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

1485
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:37,190
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?

1486
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:52,074
Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1487
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:59,675
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

1488
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:00,796
Sea turtles?

1489
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:03,197
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

1490
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:05,840
All men up the ratlines.

1491
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:08,914
All men up the ratlines!

1492
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:15,951
Oh, you want a taste of this?

1493
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:20,472
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

1494
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:23,029
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

1495
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:24,120
Sir?

1496
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:27,835
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

1497
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:30,310
about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

1498
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:33,239
Again.
- Is that so?

1499
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:36,996
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

1500
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:39,640
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1501
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:41,791
On the charts.
- Aye.

1502
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:43,240
With our own eyes.

1503
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:46,757
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

1504
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:51,155
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1505
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:53,916
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1506
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,596
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

1507
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:09,713
Sparrow.

1508
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:14,035
<i>Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me.</i>

1509
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:43,878
<i>We're devils and black sheep
Really bad eggs.</i>

1510
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:04,715
<i>Drink up, me hearties Yo ho.</i>

1511
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:20,797
<i>Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me.</i>

1512
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:23,839
<i>We pillage, we plunder.
- We rifle and loot.</i>

1513
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:25,639
<i>Drink up, me hearties Yo ho.</i>

1514
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:28,189
<i>We kidnap and ravage
And don't give a hoot.</i>

1515
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:30,033
<i>Drink up, me hearties Yo ho.</i>

1516
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:35,514
<i>Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me</i>
