4
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everybody, heads up!
- Keep it clear, now.</font>

5
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it clear!</font>

6
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand back!</font>

7
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it forward,
come on!</font>

8
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow it down!</font>

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushing team, move in there.
Move in.</font>

10
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On your ready.
I want Tasers on full charge.</font>

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Steady!
- Go on. Step back in.</font>

12
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready. Move it.</font>

13
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And push.</font>

14
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Locked. Loading team,
step away.</font>

15
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it.</font>

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jophery, raise the gate.</font>

17
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Block the opening!
- Don't let her get out!</font>

18
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody help him!</font>

19
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Work her back!</font>

20
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot her!</font>

21
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard that Hammond's
not even here.</font>

22
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sends his apologies.</font>

23
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker</font>

24
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?</font>

25
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had to leave early, his
daughter's getting a divorce.</font>

26
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, but we need to
deal with the situation now.</font>

27
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The insurance company...
You okay?</font>

28
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.</font>

29
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That makes the investors
very anxious.</font>

30
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to promise to conduct a very
thorough, on-site inspection.</font>

31
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.</font>

32
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to or they'll
pull the funding.</font>

33
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'll slow him down
even more.</font>

34
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your head.</font>

35
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If two experts sign off
on the island,</font>

36
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the insurance guys
will back off.</font>

37
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.</font>

38
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want Alan Grant.
Grant?</font>

39
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never get him
out of Montana.</font>

40
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

41
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

42
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because Grant's like me.</font>

43
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a digger.</font>

44
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.</font>

45
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate computers.</font>

46
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The feeling's mutual.</font>

47
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a look.</font>

48
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it work?</font>

49
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long
does this take?</font>

50
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should bring
an immediate return.</font>

51
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shoot the radar
into the ground,</font>

52
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the bone bounces
the image back.</font>

53
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bounces it back...</font>

54
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This new program
is incredible.</font>

55
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few more years' development, and
we won't even have to dig any more.</font>

56
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the fun in that?</font>

57
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer.</font>

58
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Post-mortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments.</font>

59
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Velociraptor?</font>

60
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Good shape, too.</font>

61
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 5, 6 feet high.
I'm guessing 9 feet long.</font>

62
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look...
What'd you do?</font>

63
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He touched it.</font>

64
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant's not
machine-compatible.</font>

65
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, they've got it
in for me.</font>

66
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrists.</font>

67
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.</font>

68
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, seriously.</font>

69
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
present-day birds than with reptiles.</font>

70
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.</font>

71
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, like a bird.</font>

72
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even the word "Raptor"
means "bird of prey."</font>

73
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't
look very scary.</font>

74
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More like a 6-foot turkey.</font>

75
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A turkey?</font>

76
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine yourself in
the Cretaceous period.</font>

77
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

78
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.</font>

79
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.</font>

80
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement,</font>

81
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.</font>

82
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no, not Velociraptor.</font>

83
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stare at him and he
just stares right back.</font>

84
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's when
the attack comes.</font>

85
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not from the front,
but from the side.</font>

86
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the other two Raptors you
didn't even know were there.</font>

87
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.</font>

88
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He uses coordinated
attack patterns</font>

89
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he is out
in force today.</font>

90
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he slashes at you
with this,</font>

91
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a 6-inch retractable claw, like
a razor, on the middle toe.</font>

92
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion. No.</font>

93
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He slashes at you</font>

94
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">here or here...</font>

95
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan.</font>

96
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.</font>

97
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.</font>

98
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you know, try to
show a little respect.</font>

99
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

100
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,</font>

101
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you could've pulled
a gun on him.</font>

102
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know. Kids.</font>

103
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to have
one of those?</font>

104
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want that kid,</font>

105
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a breed of the child
could be intriguing.</font>

106
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what's so
wrong with kids?</font>

107
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.</font>

108
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheap, cheap.</font>

109
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They smell.</font>

110
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't smell!
Some smell.</font>

111
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a break!
Babies smell.</font>

112
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!</font>

113
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to shut down!</font>

114
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut the machine!</font>

115
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cover it all up.
- Pull it over.</font>

116
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just cut it, will you?
Shut it down!</font>

117
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

118
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?</font>

119
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were saving that.</font>

120
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For today, I guarantee it.</font>

121
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who in God's name
do you think you are?</font>

122
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John Hammond.</font>

123
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.</font>

124
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I can see that my $50,000
a year has been well spent.</font>

125
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the jerk?</font>

126
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our paleobotanist,
Dr...</font>

127
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sattler.</font>

128
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.</font>

129
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance, Dr.
Sattler, but...</font>

130
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.</font>

131
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.</font>

132
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have this.
I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.</font>

133
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's samples
all over here.</font>

134
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know my way
around the kitchen.</font>

135
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'll get right
to the point.</font>

136
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like you.
Both of you.</font>

137
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can tell instantly
about people. It's a gift.</font>

138
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I own an island off the
coast of Costa Rica.</font>

139
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've leased it from the government
and during the last 5 years,</font>

140
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been setting up
a biological preserve.</font>

141
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.</font>

142
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.</font>

143
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.</font>

144
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what are those?</font>

145
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small versions of
adults, honey.</font>

146
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not just kids, everyone.</font>

147
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to open next year, if
the lawyers don't kill me first.</font>

148
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care for lawyers,
do you?</font>

149
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't really know any.
Don't really know any.</font>

150
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:57,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do, there's a particular pebble in
my shoe, who represents my investors.</font>

151
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says that they insist
on outside opinions.</font>

152
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of opinions?</font>

153
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, your kind, not to put
too fine a point on it.</font>

154
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's face it, in your particular
fields, you're the top minds.</font>

155
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I could just
persuade you</font>

156
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement,</font>

157
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.</font>

158
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would they care
what we think?</font>

159
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of park
is this?</font>

160
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right up your alley.</font>

161
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you come down, just the
pair of you, for the weekend?</font>

162
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.</font>

163
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.</font>

164
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
This isn't possible.</font>

165
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just dug up
a new skeleton...</font>

166
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...</font>

167
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a very unusual time.
The timing is...</font>

168
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for a further
3 years.</font>

169
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the plane?</font>

170
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
3 years.</font>

171
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheers.</font>

172
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dodgson!</font>

173
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't use my name.</font>

174
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dodgson. We've got
Dodgson here.</font>

175
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, nobody cares.
Nice hat.</font>

176
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you trying to look
like, a secret agent?</font>

177
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well?
$750,000.</font>

178
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.</font>

179
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's $1.5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island.</font>

180
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get them all.</font>

181
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.</font>

182
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I supposed
to transport them?</font>

183
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bottom screws open.</font>

184
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great.
Oh, my God.</font>

185
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.</font>

186
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys.
That's great.</font>

187
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Customs can even check it
if they want to.</font>

188
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see.
Go on.</font>

189
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's enough coolant
for 36 hours.</font>

190
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No menthol?</font>

191
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The embryos have to be back
here in San Jose by then.</font>

192
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's up to your guy
on the boat.</font>

193
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock.
Make sure he gets it right.</font>

194
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you planning
to beat security?</font>

195
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got
an 18-minute window.</font>

196
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18 minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.</font>

197
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get cheap on me,
Dodgson.</font>

198
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was Hammond's mistake.</font>

199
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you two
dig up dinosaurs?</font>

200
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...
We try to.</font>

201
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to get
used to Dr. Malcolm.</font>

202
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,</font>

203
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">especially for
a mathematician.</font>

204
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chaotician. Chaotician,
actually.</font>

205
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John doesn't subscribe
to chaos,</font>

206
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">particularly what it says
about his science project.</font>

207
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...</font>

208
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of the behavior
of the system in phase space?</font>

209
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching...</font>

210
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

211
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?</font>

212
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

213
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No? Non-linear equations?</font>

214
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange attractors?</font>

215
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I refuse to believe that you aren't
familiar with the concept of attraction.</font>

216
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bring scientists.
You bring a rock star.</font>

217
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.</font>

218
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad wind shears.
We have to drop pretty fast.</font>

219
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, this will
be thrilling.</font>

220
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you need that piece over
here, and that piece...</font>

221
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.</font>

222
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

223
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place?</font>

224
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the concrete moats, and the
motion-sensor tracking systems.</font>

225
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.</font>

226
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.</font>

227
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.</font>

228
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.</font>

229
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">48 hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.</font>

230
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll shut you down, John.</font>

231
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 48 hours, I'll be
accepting your apologies.</font>

232
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, slow down.
Slow. Stop!</font>

233
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This shouldn't be here.</font>

234
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan, this species of
Veriforman has been extinct</font>

235
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...</font>

236
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

237
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that.</font>

238
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dinosaur.</font>

239
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did it. Crazy son
of a bitch, you did it.</font>

240
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:04,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could tear up the rule book on
cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.</font>

241
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're wrong. This is
a warm-blooded creature.</font>

242
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing doesn't
live in a swamp.</font>

243
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing's got
a 25, 27-foot neck?</font>

244
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Brachiosaurus? 30.</font>

245
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 feet.</font>

246
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna make
a fortune with this place.</font>

247
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How fast are they?</font>

248
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we clocked the T-Rex
at 32 miles an hour.</font>

249
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-Rex?</font>

250
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you've got a T-Rex?</font>

251
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say again.</font>

252
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a T-Rex.</font>

253
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your head
between your knees.</font>

254
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant,</font>

255
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my dear Dr. Sattler,</font>

256
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">welcome to Jurassic Park.</font>

257
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're moving in herds.</font>

258
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They do move in herds.</font>

259
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do this?</font>

260
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you.</font>

261
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day.</font>

262
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,</font>

263
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">incorporating all
the latest technologies.</font>

264
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.</font>

265
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding</font>

266
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.</font>

267
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are you thinking?</font>

268
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That we're out of a job.</font>

269
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you mean "extinct"?</font>

270
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.</font>

271
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here he comes.
Well, here I come.</font>

272
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

273
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say hello.</font>

274
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

275
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, John.</font>

276
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I've got lines.</font>

277
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</font>

278
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.</font>

279
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your blood.</font>

280
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

281
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That hurt.</font>

282
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax, John. It's all part
of the miracle of cloning.</font>

283
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, John.</font>

284
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cloned from what?</font>

285
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loy extractions never recreated
an intact DNA strand.</font>

286
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without massive
sequence gaps.</font>

287
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paleo-DNA,
from what source?</font>

288
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?</font>

289
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What?</font>

290
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Mr. DNA,
where did you come from?</font>

291
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From your blood.</font>

292
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of DNA,</font>

293
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the building blocks of life.</font>

294
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:06,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A DNA strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing.</font>

295
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,</font>

296
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:17,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.</font>

297
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:22,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.</font>

298
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And just like today, they fed
on the blood of animals.</font>

299
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,</font>

300
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</font>

301
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After a long time, the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized,</font>

302
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:46,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</font>

303
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber,</font>

304
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:54,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside</font>

305
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.</font>

306
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Using sophisticated
techniques,</font>

307
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they extract
the preserved blood</font>

308
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:07,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the mosquito,
Dino DNA!</font>

309
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:13,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A full DNA strand contains
3 billion genetic codes.</font>

310
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:17,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we looked at screens like these
once a second for 8 hours a day,</font>

311
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it'd take 2 years to look
at the entire DNA strand.</font>

312
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.</font>

313
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that's where our
geneticists take over.</font>

314
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers</font>

315
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">break down the strand
in minutes.</font>

316
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And virtual-reality displays</font>

317
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</font>

318
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We used the complete
DNA of a frog</font>

319
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to fill in the holes
and complete the code.</font>

320
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</font>

321
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This score
is only temporary.</font>

322
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It all has very dramatic
music, of course.</font>

323
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.</font>

324
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then, the tour moves on.</font>

325
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, look here.
- Those hard-working cowpokes you see behind us...</font>

326
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is overwhelming, John.</font>

327
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are these characters
autoerotica?</font>

328
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we have no
animatronics here.</font>

329
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those people are the real miracle
workers of Jurassic Park.</font>

330
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs.</font>

331
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?</font>

332
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't we see
the unfertilized eggs?</font>

333
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shortly.</font>

334
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on...</font>

335
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you stop
these things?</font>

336
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
It's kind of a ride.</font>

337
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3.</font>

338
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't do that.
- What?</font>

339
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can they do that?</font>

340
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boat
for the mainland</font>

341
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be leaving at 1900.</font>

342
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:11,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.</font>

343
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day, Henry.</font>

344
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day, sir.</font>

345
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's turning the eggs.</font>

346
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.</font>

347
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, why
didn't you tell me?</font>

348
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I insist on being here
when they're born.</font>

349
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

350
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, little one.</font>

351
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, then.</font>

352
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good. Push.</font>

353
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Very good.
- God.</font>

354
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push. Come on.</font>

355
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on, then.</font>

356
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>

357
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.</font>

358
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.
Helps them to trust me.</font>

359
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:34,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island.</font>

360
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild?</font>

361
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually they can't
breed in the wild.</font>

362
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Population control is one
of our security precautions.</font>

363
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.</font>

364
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know
they can't breed?</font>

365
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:55,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.</font>

366
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've engineered them
that way.</font>

367
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>

368
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God.
- Look at that.</font>

369
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood temperature seems
like about high 80s, maybe.</font>

370
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wu?</font>

371
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">91.</font>

372
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Homoeothermic?
It holds that temperature?</font>

373
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

374
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, again, how do you know
they're all female?</font>

375
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:25,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?</font>

376
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:29,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.</font>

377
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.</font>

378
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage</font>

379
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make them male.</font>

380
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We simply deny them that.</font>

381
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deny them that?</font>

382
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, the kind of control you're
attempting is not possible.</font>

383
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,</font>

384
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's that life will
not be contained.</font>

385
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life breaks free.
Expands to new territories</font>

386
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously,</font>

387
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there it is.</font>

388
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.</font>

389
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?</font>

390
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.</font>

391
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What species is this?</font>

392
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Velociraptor.</font>

393
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bred Raptors?</font>

394
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:48,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.</font>

395
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
What are they doing?</font>

396
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feeding them.</font>

397
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:08,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu for us.
Chilean sea bass, I believe.</font>

398
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we?</font>

399
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They should all be destroyed.</font>

400
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.</font>

401
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bit of an alarmist, but knows
more about Raptors than anyone.</font>

402
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's their growth rate?</font>

403
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're lethal at
8 months, and I do mean lethal.</font>

404
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:07,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've hunted most things that can
hunt you, but the way these move...</font>

405
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fast for a biped?
Cheetah speed.</font>

406
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50, 60 miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open.</font>

407
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're
astonishing jumpers.</font>

408
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.</font>

409
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity...</font>

410
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They show extreme
intelligence.</font>

411
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even problem-solving
intelligence.</font>

412
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially the big one.</font>

413
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We bred 8 originally,
but when she came in,</font>

414
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others.</font>

415
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:39,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one, when she looks at you, you
can see she's working things out.</font>

416
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we have to
feed them like this.</font>

417
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.</font>

418
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fences are electrified,
right?</font>

419
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.</font>

420
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were testing the fences for
weaknesses, systematically.</font>

421
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They remember.</font>

422
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Well, who's hungry?</font>

423
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More adventurous guests,
of course,</font>

424
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can opt for our
jungle river cruise</font>

425
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or for a close-up look
at our majestic...</font>

426
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of these attractions are
ready yet, but the park will open</font>

427
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line</font>

428
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 or 12 months
after that.</font>

429
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely spectacular
designs.</font>

430
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spared no expense.</font>

431
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we can charge
anything we want.</font>

432
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.</font>

433
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's
the merchandise...</font>

434
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donald.</font>

435
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.</font>

436
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals.</font>

437
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:50,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure. They will.
We'll have a coupon day or something.</font>

438
00:34:55,427 --> 00:35:00,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.</font>

439
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.</font>

440
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.
They're a lot worse.</font>

441
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, wait a second, we haven't
even seen the park yet...</font>

442
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:14,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.</font>

443
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:19,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?</font>

444
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen</font>

445
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.</font>

446
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...</font>

447
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I may.</font>

448
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.</font>

449
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.</font>

450
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.</font>

451
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves</font>

452
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you don't take
any responsibility for it.</font>

453
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish</font>

454
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something as fast
as you could.</font>

455
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:55,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it</font>

456
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.</font>

457
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to sell it.</font>

458
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.</font>

459
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.</font>

460
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,</font>

461
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they didn't stop to
think if they should.</font>

462
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.</font>

463
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,</font>

464
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wouldn't have
anything to say.</font>

465
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated</font>

466
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by deforestation or
the building of a dam.</font>

467
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:32,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.</font>

468
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.</font>

469
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:43,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?</font>

470
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's so great
about discovery?</font>

471
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a violent,
penetrative act,</font>

472
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,</font>

473
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call the rape of
the natural world.</font>

474
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?</font>

475
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?</font>

476
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have poisonous plants
in this building.</font>

477
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You picked them
because they look good.</font>

478
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in</font>

479
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.</font>

480
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here</font>

481
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...</font>

482
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:29,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.</font>

483
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:34,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,</font>

484
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 species separated by 65 million years of evolution</font>

485
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.</font>

486
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?</font>

487
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe it.</font>

488
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters</font>

489
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.</font>

490
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

491
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're here.</font>

492
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.</font>

493
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spend a little time
with our target audience.</font>

494
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grandpa!
- Kids!</font>

495
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Careful with me.</font>

496
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We missed you.</font>

497
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

498
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We loved the presents.
They were great.</font>

499
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you enjoy
the helicopter?</font>

500
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.</font>

501
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, kids, come away.
- Not too close to the cars.</font>

502
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though?</font>

503
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These will be your transports
for the afternoon.</font>

504
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:44,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No drivers?</font>

505
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No drivers.
They're electric.</font>

506
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here.</font>

507
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Totally non-polluting.
Top of the line. Spared no expense.</font>

508
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an interactive CD-ROM!</font>

509
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.</font>

510
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.</font>

511
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant, come in
the second car.</font>

512
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna ride
with Dr. Sattler.</font>

513
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read your book.</font>

514
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great.</font>

515
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:27,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?</font>

516
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few species may have
evolved along those lines.</font>

517
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.</font>

518
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard that there
was this meteor,</font>

519
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:47,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.</font>

520
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen...</font>

521
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim.</font>

522
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, which car
were you planning on?</font>

523
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whichever one you are.</font>

524
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.</font>

525
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.</font>

526
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They died because
of the weather.</font>

527
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:13,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...</font>

528
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.</font>

529
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boat is now loading.</font>

530
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:26,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure.</font>

531
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm</font>

532
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about 75 miles west of us.</font>

533
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I build
in Orlando?</font>

534
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.</font>

535
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ray, start the tour program.</font>

536
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold onto your butts.</font>

537
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why did they put
the fiberglass thing?</font>

538
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

539
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to
join the future, right?</font>

540
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God help us when
the hands of engineers...</font>

541
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During your tour,</font>

542
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the appropriate
information will be</font>

543
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">automatically selected
and displayed for you.</font>

544
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look!</font>

545
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</font>

546
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we gonna hit that?</font>

547
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Jurassic Park.</font>

548
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have they got
in there, King Kong?</font>

549
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.</font>

550
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We spared no expense.</font>

551
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you look to the right,</font>

552
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</font>

553
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dilophosaurus!</font>

554
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

555
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the earliest
carnivores,</font>

556
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous</font>

557
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:22,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis,</font>

558
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</font>

559
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This makes Dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition</font>

560
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to Jurassic Park.</font>

561
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan?</font>

562
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

563
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:47,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn.</font>

564
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.</font>

565
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those shouldn't be running
off of car batteries.</font>

566
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Item 151 on
today's glitch list.</font>

567
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo</font>

568
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.</font>

569
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:12,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dennis, our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers?</font>

570
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am totally unappreciated
in my time.</font>

571
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to 3 days.</font>

572
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?</font>

573
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know anybody who can
network 8 machines</font>

574
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and de-bug 2 million lines of code on my salary?
If so, I want to see them.</font>

575
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about your financial problems, I really am.
But they are your problems.</font>

576
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.</font>

577
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.</font>

578
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really will not.</font>

579
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's been hardly
any debate at all.</font>

580
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't blame people
for their mistakes.</font>

581
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do ask that
they pay for them.</font>

582
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Dad.</font>

583
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The headlights.</font>

584
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?</font>

585
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll eat a lot of
compute cycles.</font>

586
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll lose part
of the system.</font>

587
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.</font>

588
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour...</font>

589
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet, all of you!</font>

590
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.</font>

591
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:06,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.</font>

592
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.</font>

593
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dinosaurs eat man.</font>

594

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Woman inherits the earth.</font>

595
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
- Keep watching the fence.</font>

596
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going to happen
to the goat?</font>

597
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to eat the goat?</font>

598
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent.</font>

599
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?</font>

600
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I happen to be a vegetarian.</font>

601
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.</font>

602
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:15,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.</font>

603
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:42,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</font>

604
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello. Yes?</font>

605
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really hate that man.</font>

606
00:46:55,855 --> 00:47:00,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any
set patterns or park schedules.</font>

607
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The essence of chaos.</font>

608
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still not
clear on chaos.</font>

609
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems.</font>

610
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:15,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shorthand is
the Butterfly Effect.</font>

611
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking</font>

612
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.</font>

613
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was I going too fast?
I missed it.</font>

614
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did a fly-by.</font>

615
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.</font>

616
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should be still.
The car's bouncing.</font>

617
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's okay.
It's just an example.</font>

618
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.</font>

619
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A drop of water falls
on your hand.</font>

620
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?</font>

621
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thumb, I'd say.</font>

622
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze your hand.
Don't move.</font>

623
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do the same thing, start
with the same place again.</font>

624
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way, now?</font>

625
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's say back
the same way.</font>

626
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It changed. Why?</font>

627
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because tiny variations,</font>

628
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...</font>

629
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan, look at this.</font>

630
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The amount of blood distending your
vessels, imperfections in the skin...</font>

631
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"imperfections in the skin"?</font>

632
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just microscopic,</font>

633
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome.</font>

634
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what?</font>

635
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unpredictability.</font>

636
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. Look at this.
See? I'm right again.</font>

637
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody could predict that Dr.
Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.</font>

638
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's another example.</font>

639
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, here I am now by myself, talking to myself.
That's Chaos Theory.</font>

640
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop the program.</font>

641
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:50,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.</font>

642
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.</font>

643
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on.
Will notify for resume.</font>

644
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll switch it
over to TelePrompTer.</font>

645
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about
the circuit integrities?</font>

646
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screen says faulty sensor.</font>

647
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:06,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll call security.</font>

648
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're at full go
on that and it looks good.</font>

649
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said, there's this other
book by a guy named Bakker</font>

650
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases.</font>

651
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we going?</font>

652
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't say
they turned into birds.</font>

653
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?</font>

654
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.</font>

655
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
Yours was fully illustrated.</font>

656
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

657
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.
Wait. Watch.</font>

658
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Watch this.</font>

659
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

660
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody stay here.</font>

661
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

662
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

663
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

664
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't be scared.
- Come on, it's okay.</font>

665
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Muldoon tranquillized her
for me.</font>

666
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's sick.</font>

667
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

668
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, baby.</font>

669
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was always my favorite
when I was a kid</font>

670
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now I see she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.</font>

671
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

672
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Microvesicles.
That's interesting.</font>

673
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.
What are her symptoms?</font>

674
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.</font>

675
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems to happen
every 6 weeks or so.</font>

676
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 weeks.</font>

677
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are dilated.
They are?</font>

678
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a look.</font>

679
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be damned.</font>

680
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:34,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.</font>

681
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this West Indian lilac?</font>

682
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. We know they're toxic, but
the animals don't eat them.</font>

683
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>

684
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty sure.</font>

685
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one way
to be positive.</font>

686
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.</font>

687
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dino droppings?
Droppings?</font>

688
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got that.</font>

689
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.</font>

690
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have to
cut the tour short.</font>

691
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll pick it up
again tomorrow.</font>

692
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure we have to?</font>

693
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not worth
taking the chance.</font>

694
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sustained winds at 45 knots.</font>

695
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them when they get
back in the cars.</font>

696
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:35,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in 5 minutes.</font>

697
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop what you're doing
and leave now.</font>

698
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:40,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn!</font>

699
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is one
big pile of shit.</font>

700
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.</font>

701
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's so odd, though.</font>

702
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, she's suffering
from Melia toxicity</font>

703
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every 6 weeks.</font>

704
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see, rats.</font>

705
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's tenacious.</font>

706
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea.</font>

707
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:28,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?</font>

708
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.</font>

709
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to stay with Dr.
Harding and finish up with the Trike.</font>

710
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.</font>

711
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll drop her off at the
center before I make the boat.</font>

712
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. Then I'll catch
up with you later.</font>

713
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure?</font>

714
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.</font>

715
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>

716
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:23,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we got to go, we got to go.</font>

717
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to
give me the time.</font>

718
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18</font>

719
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.</font>

720
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No promises.</font>

721
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.</font>

722
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:50,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So much for our first tour.
2 no-shows and one sick Triceratops.</font>

723
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could've been worse.</font>

724
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot worse.</font>

725
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:00,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.</font>

726
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:02,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.</font>

727
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:06,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had only sweets and I'm
gonna get something salty.</font>

728
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I finished
debugging the phones.</font>

729
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was going to, so I did.</font>

730
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe</font>

731
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should tell you the system
will be compiling</font>

732
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems,</font>

733
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:25,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.</font>

734
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you got any kids?</font>

735
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? Hell, yeah.
Three. I love kids.</font>

736
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything at all can
and does happen.</font>

737
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same with wives,
for that matter.</font>

738
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're married?</font>

739
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally.</font>

740
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.</font>

741
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5, 4, 3,</font>

742
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2, 1.</font>

743
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's odd.
- What?</font>

744
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Door security systems
are shutting down.</font>

745
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?</font>

746
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, Dr. Sattler,</font>

747
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's not available,
is she?</font>

748
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

749
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. You two are...</font>

750
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

751
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd I touch?</font>

752
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't touch anything.
We stopped.</font>

753
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

754
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now?</font>

755
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fences are failing
all over the park.</font>

756
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find Nedry. Check
the vending machines.</font>

757
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look at this
work station.</font>

758
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a complete slob.</font>

759
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Raptor fences
aren't out, are they?</font>

760
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. They're still on.</font>

761
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?</font>

762
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Access main program.</font>

763
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Access main security.</font>

764
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Access main program grid.</font>

765
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't say
the magic word.</font>

766
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please! God damn it.
I hate this hacker crap.</font>

767
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phone Nedry's
people in Cambridge.</font>

768
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phones are out, too.</font>

769
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did the vehicles stop?</font>

770
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their radio's out, too.</font>

771
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gennaro said to stay put.
Kids okay?</font>

772
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?</font>

773
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids get scared.
What's scary?</font>

774
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I'm not scared.</font>

775
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:56,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say
you were scared.</font>

776
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

777
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boo!</font>

778
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where did
you find those?</font>

779
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the box, under my seat.</font>

780
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they heavy?</font>

781
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Then they're expensive.
Put them back.</font>

782
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't scare me.</font>

783
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:31,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool. Night vision.</font>

784
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you feel that?</font>

785
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.</font>

786
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

787
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the goat?</font>

788
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus!</font>

789
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left us.</font>

790
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does he think
he's going?</font>

791
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you got to go,
you got to go.</font>

792
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant.</font>

793
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate being
right all the time.</font>

794
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.</font>

795
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:47,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn the light off.</font>

796
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn the light off!</font>

797
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry! Turn it off!</font>

798
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry!</font>

799
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one
who turned it...</font>

800
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ian, freeze!</font>

801
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:21,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the kids!</font>

802
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of the flare!</font>

803
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the kids!</font>

804
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of the flare!</font>

805
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hail Mary,
full of grace...</font>

806
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

807
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant!</font>

808
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm stuck.
The seat's got my feet.</font>

809
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get you next.
You're okay.</font>

810
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all right.</font>

811
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim!</font>

812
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.</font>

813
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, you're choking me.</font>

814
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:28,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab the wire.</font>

815
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:52,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."</font>

816
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:55,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.</font>

817
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this next entry. It's the kicker.
"White rabbit object."</font>

818
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It did it all.
With the keychecks off,</font>

819
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the computer didn't
file the keystrokes.</font>

820
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:06,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The way to find them is to check the
computer's lines of code one by one.</font>

821
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many lines of
code are there?</font>

822
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About 2 million.</font>

823
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 million?
Yeah.</font>

824
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:19,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep</font>

825
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring back
my grandchildren.</font>

826
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

827
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going with him.</font>

828
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:33,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John.</font>

829
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get Jurassic Park back
online without Dennis Nedry.</font>

830
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should have been
there by now.</font>

831
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:04,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

832
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the road!</font>

833
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Winch this sucker off the thing and
then I tie it to that thing there.</font>

834
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.</font>

835
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My glasses. I can
afford more glasses!</font>

836
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.</font>

837
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

838
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's nice.
I've got to go.</font>

839
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice boy.</font>

840
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice dinosaur.</font>

841
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:48,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.</font>

842
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:52,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.</font>

843
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.</font>

844
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on. Play fetch?</font>

845
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, stick.</font>

846
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at stick.</font>

847
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:10,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy.
Look at the stick.</font>

848
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like the stick?
Go on and get it.</font>

849
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No wonder you're extinct.</font>

850
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.</font>

851
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Timmy!</font>

852
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Lex. Listen.</font>

853
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, I'm right here.</font>

854
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.</font>

855
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay right here
and wait for me.</font>

856
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left us.</font>

857
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:56,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not what
I'm going to do.</font>

858
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

859
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here.</font>

860
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me?
I'm coming up.</font>

861
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate climbing.
I hate trees, way too high.</font>

862
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

863
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I threw up.</font>

864
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:14,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's okay.</font>

865
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give me your hand.</font>

866
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.</font>

867
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, I've got you.</font>

868
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

869
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good.
Over the rail.</font>

870
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't pull me too hard.</font>

871
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:50,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stand on the door.
- Hang on to me.</font>

872
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
Yes, it is.</font>

873
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?</font>

874
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
Yeah, me, too.</font>

875
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.</font>

876
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is impossible.</font>

877
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:08,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I going to do this?
It's about...</font>

878
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to help you
with your footing.</font>

879
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:16,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

880
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:18,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, go.</font>

881
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, Tim, go!</font>

882
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster, Tim!</font>

883
01:17:58,758 --> 01:17:59,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, jump!</font>

884
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:04,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, Tim.</font>

885
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're back
in the car again.</font>

886
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:20,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least
you're out of the tree.</font>

887
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the other car?</font>

888
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan!</font>

889
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant!</font>

890
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:52,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this was Gennaro.</font>

891
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this was, too.</font>

892
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:58,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's ahead of us.</font>

893
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could be anywhere.</font>

894
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With fences down, it can wander in
and out of any paddock it likes.</font>

895
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.</font>

896
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:16,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.</font>

897
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:23,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we chance moving him?</font>

898
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please chance it.</font>

899
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, come on!</font>

900
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the other car!</font>

901
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant?</font>

902
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not here.</font>

903
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody hear that?</font>

904
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an impact tremor,
is what it is.</font>

905
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fairly alarmed here.</font>

906
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:37,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now! Right now!</font>

907
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

908
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must go faster.</font>

909
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it comes!
Stand on it! Fifth gear!</font>

910
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off the stick!
Bloody move!</font>

911
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out!</font>

912
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think they'll have
that on the tour?</font>

913
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you hearing this?</font>

914
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Tim.
- Hurry up.</font>

915
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get up this tree.</font>

916
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.</font>

917
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font>

918
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate trees.</font>

919
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't bother me.</font>

920
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Well, you weren't
in the last one.</font>

921
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:31,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.</font>

922
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're singing.</font>

923
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let the monsters
come over here.</font>

924
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.</font>

925
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.</font>

926
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate the other kind.</font>

927
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just do what they do.</font>

928
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:40,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

929
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you and Ellie going to do now,
if you don't dig up bones any more?</font>

930
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

931
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we'll just
have to evolve, too.</font>

932
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:06,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you call
a blind dinosaur?</font>

933
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Do-you-think-he-saurus."</font>

934
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you call
a blind dinosaur's dog?</font>

935
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:16,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got me.</font>

936
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A "Do-you-think
He-saurus rex."</font>

937
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan?</font>

938
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

939
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:27,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if the dinosaurs come
back while we're all asleep?</font>

940
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll stay awake.
All night?</font>

941
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:35,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All night.</font>

942
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were all melting.</font>

943
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:34,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.</font>

944
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll be fine.</font>

945
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:45,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?</font>

946
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the first</font>

947
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:55,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland</font>

948
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.</font>

949
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really quite wonderful.</font>

950
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:07,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a wee trapeze
and a</font>

951
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">carousel</font>

952
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a seesaw.</font>

953
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all move motorized,
of course.</font>

954
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas."</font>

955
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Can't you see the fleas?"</font>

956
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:30,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.</font>

957
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With this place,</font>

958
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:43,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.</font>

959
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:47,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something that was real.
Something that they could</font>

960
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">see and touch.</font>

961
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An aim not
devoid of merit.</font>

962
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.</font>

963
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're absolutely right.</font>

964
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.</font>

965
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're over-dependent on
automation, I can see that now.</font>

966
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:20,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time,
everything's correctable.</font>

967
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:24,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Creation is an act
of sheer will.</font>

968
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:29,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time,
it'll be flawless.</font>

969
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.</font>

970
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we have control...</font>

971
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:37,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've never had control!
That's the illusion.</font>

972
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.</font>

973
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a mistake, too.</font>

974
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:47,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't have enough respect for
that power, and it's out now.</font>

975
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing that matters
now are the people we love.</font>

976
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan and Lex and Tim.</font>

977
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:02,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, they're out there,
where people are dying.</font>

978
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good.</font>

979
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spared no expense.</font>

980
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:53,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go away!</font>

981
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.
It's a Brachiosaurus.</font>

982
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."</font>

983
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:01,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Veggie.</font>

984
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on, girl.</font>

985
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, baby.</font>

986
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

987
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:17,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not letting go.</font>

988
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like
it has a cold.</font>

989
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Maybe.</font>

990
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I touch it?
Sure.</font>

991
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:37,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just think of it
as kind of a big cow.</font>

992
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like cows.</font>

993
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.</font>

994
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:03,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God bless you.</font>

995
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yuck.
- Great.</font>

996
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now she'll never
try anything new.</font>

997
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll sit in her room, never
come out, play on her computer.</font>

998
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:17,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a hacker.</font>

999
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:19,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I said.
You're a nerd.</font>

1000
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not
a computer nerd.</font>

1001
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prefer to be
called a hacker.</font>

1002
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:23,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God.</font>

1003
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what this is?</font>

1004
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:34,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dinosaur egg.</font>

1005
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:38,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dinosaurs are breeding.</font>

1006
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:45,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.</font>

1007
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:49,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amphibian DNA.
What's that?</font>

1008
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, on the tour,</font>

1009
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:57,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.</font>

1010
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They mutated the dinosaur
genetic code</font>

1011
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and blended it with
that of frogs.</font>

1012
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:12,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female</font>

1013
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a single sex environment.</font>

1014
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:17,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malcolm was right.</font>

1015
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

1016
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life found a way.</font>

1017
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. That's crazy.
- You're out of your mind.</font>

1018
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's absolutely
out of his mind.</font>

1019
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.
What exactly would this mean?</font>

1020
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're talking about
a calculated risk,</font>

1021
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is the only
option left to us.</font>

1022
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:48,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.</font>

1023
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:52,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.</font>

1024
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, shutting down
the entire system...</font>

1025
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get somebody else.
I won't do it.</font>

1026
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:01,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did.</font>

1027
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:06,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back</font>

1028
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on their original
start-up mode. Correct?</font>

1029
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theoretically, yes. We've never
shut down the entire system before.</font>

1030
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:14,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may not come back on.</font>

1031
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would we get
the phones back?</font>

1032
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, again, in theory.</font>

1033
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about
the lysine contingency?</font>

1034
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could put
that into effect.</font>

1035
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1036
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's absolutely out
of the question.</font>

1037
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals,</font>

1038
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if they ever get
off the island.</font>

1039
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:33,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.</font>

1040
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.</font>

1041
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless they're supplied with lysine
by us, they slip into a coma and die.</font>

1042
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are dying.</font>

1043
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you please shut
down the system?</font>

1044
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on to your butts.</font>

1045
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:34,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1046
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, see that?
It's on. It worked.</font>

1047
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.</font>

1048
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:43,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.</font>

1049
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:46,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn them back on,
reboot a few systems:</font>

1050
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:49,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Telephones, security doors, half
dozen others, but it worked.</font>

1051
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">System's ready.
Where are the breakers?</font>

1052
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maintenance shed
at the end of the compound.</font>

1053
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:56,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 minutes, I'll have the
power back on in the park.</font>

1054
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker</font>

1055
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until Mr. Arnold returns, and the
whole system's running again.</font>

1056
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tired.
I'm dirty.</font>

1057
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hot.</font>

1058
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:10,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking at the map, I'd say the
visitor's center is just a mile</font>

1059
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over that rise there.
Just keep...</font>

1060
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:18,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1061
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, can you tell me
what they are?</font>

1062
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are</font>

1063
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:31,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gallimimus.</font>

1064
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are those meat-eating?</font>

1065
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Meat-asauruses"?</font>

1066
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.</font>

1067
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:47,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.</font>

1068
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're flocking this way.</font>

1069
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go now.</font>

1070
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look how it eats.</font>

1071
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:38,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1072
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you'll never look at
birds the same way again.</font>

1073
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.
Go now.</font>

1074
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Keep low
and follow me.</font>

1075
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look how much blood.</font>

1076
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God. Something went wrong.</font>

1077
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:01,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's happened.
Something's wrong.</font>

1078
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:05,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is just a delay.</font>

1079
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.</font>

1080
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:13,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked.</font>

1081
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,</font>

1082
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the pirates don't
eat tourists.</font>

1083
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:20,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wait any more.
Something's wrong.</font>

1084
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go get
the power back on.</font>

1085
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just stroll
down the road, you know?</font>

1086
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:29,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, it's only been gone...</font>

1087
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going with you.
Okay.</font>

1088
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:50,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

1089
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:58,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this isn't going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light.</font>

1090
01:36:58,897 --> 01:37:02,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.</font>

1091
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:07,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1092
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:15,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it ought to be me,
really, going.</font>

1093
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:16,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1094
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a... And you're a...</font>

1095
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.
Come on, let's go.</font>

1096
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:26,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.</font>

1097
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.</font>

1098
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:30,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1099
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shutdown must've
turned off all the fences.</font>

1100
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.</font>

1101
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:20,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, this way.</font>

1102
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:30,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see the shed
from here.</font>

1103
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can make it if we run.</font>

1104
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:35,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We can't.</font>

1105
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

1106
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:39,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we're being hunted.</font>

1107
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the bushes,
straight ahead.</font>

1108
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>

1109
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:49,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like hell it is.</font>

1110
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run. Towards the shed.</font>

1111
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:57,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got her.</font>

1112
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Now!</font>

1113
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Arnold?</font>

1114
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:26,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, I'm in.</font>

1115
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:28,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

1116
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:33,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.</font>

1117
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:36,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Going down.</font>

1118
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:41,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.</font>

1119
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:42,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have her follow
the main cable.</font>

1120
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how to read
a schematic.</font>

1121
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:17,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess that means
the power's off.</font>

1122
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:31,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not funny.</font>

1123
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:33,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was great.</font>

1124
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe we, we could...</font>

1125
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:57,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it. Dead end.</font>

1126
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

1127
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:04,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.</font>

1128
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look above you.</font>

1129
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:11,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.</font>

1130
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:12,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow that.</font>

1131
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Following the piping.</font>

1132
01:41:18,448 --> 01:41:22,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.</font>

1133
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you give me?</font>

1134
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Respect.</font>

1135
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:28,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, guys,
it's not a race.</font>

1136
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see the box.</font>

1137
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:36,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says, "High Voltage."
Yeah.</font>

1138
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1139
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Here we go.</font>

1140
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:48,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over the top.</font>

1141
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:50,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your time.</font>

1142
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:53,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Come on.</font>

1143
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find your footing.</font>

1144
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:00,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't throw
the main switch by hand.</font>

1145
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:04,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.</font>

1146
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:06,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's large, flat, and gray.</font>

1147
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
here I go. Okay?</font>

1148
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:15,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One, two, three, four.</font>

1149
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, charged.</font>

1150
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:22,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button</font>

1151
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which says "Push to Close."</font>

1152
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push to close.</font>

1153
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:32,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push it.</font>

1154
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:51,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.</font>

1155
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Switch them on.</font>

1156
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:05,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down now!</font>

1157
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to jump.</font>

1158
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:08,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.</font>

1159
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what Dr. Grant says!</font>

1160
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:11,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go.
I'll count to 3.</font>

1161
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:14,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3!</font>

1162
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:17,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4. 5.</font>

1163
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:19,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming up to get you.</font>

1164
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:21,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to get Tim.</font>

1165
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm gonna
count to 3.</font>

1166
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:27,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1,</font>

1167
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:30,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2...</font>

1168
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not breathing.</font>

1169
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:50,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're back
in business!</font>

1170
01:43:58,524 --> 01:43:59,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1171
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clever girl.</font>

1172
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:56,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Tim!</font>

1173
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy.</font>

1174
01:46:06,152 --> 01:46:07,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>

1175
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:13,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1176
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:27,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm gonna have
to find the others.</font>

1177
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:31,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get you to a doctor.</font>

1178
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:35,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, you look after Tim.
Yeah.</font>

1179
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:38,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your hair is
all sticking up.</font>

1180
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big Tim, the human
piece of toast.</font>

1181
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back soon.
I promise.</font>

1182
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:17,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run.</font>

1183
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the two Raptors, right?</font>

1184
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure the third
one's contained?</font>

1185
01:48:39,722 --> 01:48:43,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.</font>

1186
01:49:09,919 --> 01:49:11,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1187
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Velociraptor.</font>

1188
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:17,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's inside.</font>

1189
01:49:42,952 --> 01:49:44,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

1190
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:20,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in there.</font>

1191
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:22,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Control room.</font>

1192
01:52:29,326 --> 01:52:30,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can
call for help?</font>

1193
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:32,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got to reboot
the system first.</font>

1194
01:52:35,457 --> 01:52:36,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The door locks!</font>

1195
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:39,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, boot up
the door locks!</font>

1196
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:51,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, boot up
the door locks!</font>

1197
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Boot up
the door locks.</font>

1198
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:55,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't hold it
by yourself!</font>

1199
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:07,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a UNIX system.
I know this.</font>

1200
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all the files
of the whole park.</font>

1201
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.</font>

1202
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:16,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try to reach the gun.</font>

1203
01:53:24,882 --> 01:53:26,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get it
unless I move.</font>

1204
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:44,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it. This might
be the right file.</font>

1205
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:02,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it!
Yes!</font>

1206
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:07,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it!</font>

1207
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:08,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1208
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:14,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What works?</font>

1209
01:54:14,306 --> 01:54:17,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All security systems
are enabled. We got it.</font>

1210
01:54:26,902 --> 01:54:28,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grant.</font>

1211
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:31,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Hammond,
the phones are working.</font>

1212
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:32,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The children all right?</font>

1213
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:34,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The children are fine.</font>

1214
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:38,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call the mainland.
Tell them to send the damn helicopters.</font>

1215
01:54:39,414 --> 01:54:41,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna cut
through the glass!</font>

1216
01:55:33,302 --> 01:55:34,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

1217
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:22,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, let go. Yeah!</font>

1218
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:44,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After careful consideration, I've
decided not to endorse your park.</font>

1219
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So have I.</font>

1220
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:35,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
