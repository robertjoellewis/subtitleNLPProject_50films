1
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,562
Hey!

2
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,063
If you want any tickets,

3
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:50,777
you'll have to go around to the front of...

4
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,613
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

5
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,823
What the hell am I doing around here?

6
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,200
They walk in here and...

7
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,750
Let's see. I hope I got...

8
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,919
Three?

9
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,228
That'll be $7...

10
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,485
...and 50 cents.

11
00:06:49,910 --> 00:10:55,779
No.

12
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,711
Frank?

13
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,508
Frank sent us.

14
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,055
Did you bring a horse for me?

15
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,605
Well, looks like we're...

16
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,276
Looks like we're shy one horse.

17
00:13:03,450 --> 00:14:26,615
You brought two too many.

18
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,946
Hey, Pa!

19
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,406
Look!

20
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,350
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

21
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,406
Timmy.

22
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,001
Maureen, look.

23
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,462
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

24
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,214
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

25
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,843
Patrick's already left
for the station, huh?

26
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,803
He's getting ready, Pa.

27
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,139
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

28
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,853
Not bad, I'd say.

29
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,483
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

30
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,361
But these are the same slices as usual.

31
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,242
Yeah, sure.

32
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,787
As usual.

33
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,875
Maureen.

34
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:54,549
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

35
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,469
You'll have beautiful new clothes

36
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,346
and you won't have to work no more.

37
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,391
We're going to get rich, Pa?

38
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,898
Who knows?

39
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,234
Patrick!

40
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,903
Wait a minute!

41
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,074
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean them.

42
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,122
The train will come in

43
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,041
and there won't be no one
to meet your mother.

44
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,586
Our mother died six years ago.

45
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,350
Go now, or you'll really be late.

46
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,691
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?

47
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,901
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

48
00:19:54,986 --> 00:20:00,657
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

49
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:06,955
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

50
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:14,170
"and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

51
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,435
I'm gonna get some fresh water
from the well.

52
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,481
Oh, Danny boy

53
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,736
The pipes, the pipes are calling

54
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,075
And down the mountain side

55
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,952
The summer's gone

56
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,373
And all the roses fall...

57
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,098
Maureen!

58
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,353
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

59
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,912
Now that you've called me by name...

60
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,140
I saw some mighty fine stock
down south.

61
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,808
Is that so?

62
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,353
And the prices are good.

63
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,157
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

64
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,409
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

65
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,787
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.

66
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,727
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?

67
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,647
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

68
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,441
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

69
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,902
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

70
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:58,074
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

71
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,368
I got a whole train to unload.

72
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,621
All right,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

73
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,165
Come on! Come on!

74
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,419
What's the name of the place
you wanted to go?

75
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,462
Sweetwater.

76
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,717
Brett McBain's farm.

77
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,263
McBain? Yeah, sure.

78
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,765
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

79
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,728
tilling sand for years way out there
in the middle of nowhere.

80
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,605
Sweetwater!

81
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,648
Only a loony like him could call

82
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,818
that stinking piece of desert
Sweetwater.

83
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,237
Sweetwater!

84
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,993
That's good! Sweetwater!

85
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,665
That's right. A little more to the right.

86
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,541
Higher. Higher.

87
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,003
Hold it there.

88
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,391
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

89
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,894
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

90
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,772
Hey, slow down.
What's the matter with you? Slow down!

91
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,816
Hey, boys! Watch out!

92
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,111
Watch out down there!

93
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,237
Slow down!

94
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,348
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

95
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,725
Don't the train stop?

96
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,334
What can I do for you, ma'am?

97
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,171
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

98
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,422
Water?

99
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,842
Well, you see, that word
is poison around these parts

100
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,219
ever since the days of the great flood.

101
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,723
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

102
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,517
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

103
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,144
You sure can.

104
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,271
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

105
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,647
And you're lucky.

106
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,649
Only three people
have used it this morning.

107
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,236
Used it one at a time or all together?

108
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,244
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

109
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,498
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

110
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,958
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

111
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,211
- You've been there?
- No.

112
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,922
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

113
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,257
You know, she...

114
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,484
Jug.

115
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:27,614
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

116
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,747
Do you know how to blow music
from that?

117
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,810
Pick it up.

118
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:23,796
You!

119
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,514
You don't know how to play.

120
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,456
Try this one.

121
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,056
Take it.

122
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,743
Go on.

123
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,423
Here.

124
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,840
Bravo.

125
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,282
Cheyenne.

126
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,576
We thought we'd never make it.

127
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,496
It's all right. You're right on time.

128
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,292
To bury my escort.

129
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,588
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

130
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,773
Hey.

131
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,158
The gun.

132
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,267
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

133
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,818
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

134
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,902
They were waiting for a train.

135
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,579
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

136
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,707
So?

137
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,795
Inside the men, there were three bullets.

138
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:48,393
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

139
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,064
For two reasons.

140
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,942
One, nobody around
these parts got the guts

141
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,945
to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

142
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:03,658
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.

143
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,456
That surprise you?

144
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,500
Yeah.

145
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,964
Well, you know music.

146
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,885
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

147
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,896
All the way up to six, if I have to.

148
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:35,982
And maybe faster than you.

149
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,957
Yeah, go on.

150
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,292
Play, Harmonica.

151
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,045
Play, so you can't bullshit.

152
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,174
Only, watch those false notes.

153
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,643
Like so?

154
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,951
And so, this cousin of mine

155
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,870
keeps writing me
to come on down to New Orleans.

156
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,665
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

157
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,918
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

158
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,462
It's too full of fast men
and loose women.

159
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,048
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

160
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:47,387
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet, simple country life.

161
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,789
He's Timmy.

162
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,958
Yes.

163
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,753
Dear God.

164
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,214
On the day...

165
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,677
On the very day of your wedding.

166
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:34,846
Poor little miss.

167
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,350
Mrs...

168
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,853
Mrs. McBain.

169
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,773
But we all... But we thought...

170
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,359
I know.

171
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,694
It was to be a surprise today.

172
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,865
Brett McBain and I were married.

173
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,992
A month ago.

174
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,745
In New Orleans.

175
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,639
"I am the resurrection, and the life.

176
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,351
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

177
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,896
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."

178
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,106
Amen.

179
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,791
- Mr. Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

180
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,880
I found this collar on a nail by the door.

181
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,638
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

182
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,807
Cheyenne's hand.

183
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:06,187
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

184
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,815
We'll make them tell us
before we hang them.

185
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,235
Let's get moving.

186
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,755
Come on.

187
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,633
Let's go back to Flagstone.

188
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,430
No, Sam.

189
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,433
You go back.

190
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,437
You don't want to stay out here alone.

191
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,440
Why not?

192
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,484
This is my home.

193
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,349
You know, Wobbles,

194
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,936
I'm kind of mad at you.

195
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,276
Frank wasn't there.

196
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,988
He sent three friends.

197
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,782
I don't know nothing, I swear.

198
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,495
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

199
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,957
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

200
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,878
- I swear to you that I...
- 'Cause he was at the McBains'.

201
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:25,214
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

202
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,092
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

203
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,553
That was always one of Frank's tricks.

204
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,430
Faking evidence.

205
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,850
I don't know.

206
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,477
I swear.

207
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,939
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

208
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,484
I don't know nothing.

209
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,522
Who's there?

210
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,718
Did you make coffee?

211
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,098
Make it.

212
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,775
Didn't sleep a wink.

213
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:40,988
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

214
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,827
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

215
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,121
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

216
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,977
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

217
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,154
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

218
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,741
Idiots.

219
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,993
What the hell?

220
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,247
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

221
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,041
Be like killing a priest.

222
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:37,044
A Catholic priest, that is.

223
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:41,090
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

224
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:00,818
See, I ain't the mean bastard
people make out.

225
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:09,201
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,

226
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,038
it fires me up.

227
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,668
And a fired-up Cheyenne

228
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,881
ain't a nice thing to see.

229
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,717
Especially for a lady.

230
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:40,566
But you're too smart to make him mad.

231
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:50,242
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

232
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,244
Yeah.

233
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,249
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

234
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:07,760
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,

235
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,183
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

236
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,603
I don't like it none.

237
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,814
But I can understand it.

238
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:29,198
What I don't understand is why.

239
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,701
Neither do I.

240
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,793
But I see you looked a lot for the why.

241
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,592
Yeah.

242
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,057
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

243
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,228
Round. Yellow.

244
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,481
You know the kind.

245
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,818
You rap them on a stone

246
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,779
and they go "ding."

247
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,698
Maybe.

248
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:15,494
But I didn't find them.

249
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,751
By the way,

250
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:27,131
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

251
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,969
He's somebody you'd remember.

252
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,265
Instead of talking, he plays.

253
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,311
And when he'd better play, he talks.

254
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,444
You know, ma'am, when you've
killed four, it's easy to make it five.

255
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,200
Sure. You're an expert.

256
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,000
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

257
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,257
Of course I have.

258
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,595
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

259
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,349
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

260
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,309
And even call in your men.

261
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,228
Well, no woman ever died from that.

262
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,982
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

263
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,818
and I'll be exactly what I was before.

264
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,739
With just another filthy memory.

265
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,424
You make good coffee, at least?

266
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,718
Not bad.

267
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:56,970
Congratulations.

268
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:01,141
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

269
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,644
I only told you to scare them.

270
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,398
People scare better when they're dying.

271
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:11,568
And can you tell me what good
was your stupid massacre?

272
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,155
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

273
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:21,161
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

274
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,790
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.

275
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,460
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

276
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,672
You know that.

277
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:36,552
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

278
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,887
and before my eyes rot,

279
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,560
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

280
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,105
I know where you got on board.

281
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,816
I was there, too, remember?

282
01:07:55,697 --> 01:08:01,326
"To remove small obstacles
from the track," you said.

283
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,997
Well, there were a few.

284
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,045
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

285
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,172
And fast.

286
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:17,801
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

287
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,474
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

288
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,019
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

289
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:33,859
I watch that dry rot rise
a little more every day.

290
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:38,906
Any normal man would
put a bullet in his brain.

291
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:43,118
But you, you just got a little more hasty.

292
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,205
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

293
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,832
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

294
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,292
A lot.

295
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,214
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

296
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,593
Now, you're keeping in the background.

297
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,223
You'll end up giving orders.

298
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:09,811
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

299
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,275
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

300
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:18,946
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

301
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:33,126
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

302
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,924
It's almost like holding a gun.

303
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:46,431
Only much more powerful.

304
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:05,534
You see, staying with you,

305
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,455
I'm beginning to think big, too.

306
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,544
This McBain business

307
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,464
has given me ideas.

308
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:29,725
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

309
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,187
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

310
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,233
Why?

311
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:43,989
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

312
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,668
This is one of them.

313
01:10:57,629 --> 01:11:01,381
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

314
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:06,303
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

315
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,652
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

316
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,658
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

317
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,955
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

318
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,251
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

319
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,923
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

320
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,801
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

321
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,679
And then you happen
to meet a man like this,

322
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,347
who looked like a good man.

323
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,933
Clear eyes, strong hands.

324
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,352
And he wants to marry you.

325
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,604
Which doesn't happen often.

326
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:43,024
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

327
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:49,156
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.

328
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,576
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

329
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:58,165
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.

330
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,795
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"

331
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,684
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

332
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:22,564
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

333
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,041
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

334
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,587
If you can find it, you're welcome to it.

335
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,465
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

336
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,968
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

337
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,942
You deserve better.

338
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,323
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

339
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,502
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

340
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,842
She was the biggest whore in Alameda

341
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,553
and the finest woman that ever lived.

342
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,724
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,

343
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,270
he must have been a happy man.

344
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,449
Hey! Hey!

345
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,077
Hey!

346
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,478
What do you want?

347
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:09,022
Cheyenne's right.

348
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:13,234
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

349
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,709
This isn't the time to leave.

350
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,815
Give me some water.

351
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:44,909
From the well.

352
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,705
I like my water fresh.

353
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,294
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

354
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,006
A sound? Like what?

355
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,259
Like that.

356
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,378
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

357
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,747
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

358
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:38,750
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

359
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,878
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

360
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,922
I remember very well.

361
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:47,175
Is there something I can do for you?

362
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,761
Yes.

363
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,433
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

364
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,519
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

365
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,231
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

366
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:05,360
I got my own worries,
and all I want is to be left in peace.

367
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,988
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.

368
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,088
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

369
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:11,217
Whatever business you have with Frank,
keep it far away from here.

370
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:12,760
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton,

371
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,679
but when I heard that woman say
she knew everything,

372
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,140
I thought that the important thing
was for me to come over here

373
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,433
right away and tell you about it.

374
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,560
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

375
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,854
Sure, but you know
that I'm mighty careful, Frank.

376
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,273
No one could have followed me.

377
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:28,234
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

378
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,945
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

379
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,116
You should learn to live
as if you didn't exist.

380
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,744
You've known me a long time, Frank.

381
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,662
You know you can trust me.

382
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,497
Wobbles.

383
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,881
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

384
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:53,801
The man can't even trust his own pants.

385
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,063
Let's get out of here.

386
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,581
The end of the line.

387
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,585
Yeah.

388
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,050
Get him on board.

389
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,317
Tie him up.

390
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,352
Wait, Frank.

391
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,646
I didn't...

392
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,523
So, nobody followed you?

393
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,442
No. You gotta believe me.

394
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,946
So, this is the way I can trust you.

395
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,949
I can explain. I didn't know that he...

396
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,536
- Get out.
- No. No. No, Frank.

397
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:08,871
Get out.

398
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,976
Frank, wait!

399
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,292
I told you to keep quiet.

400
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:01,465
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?

401
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,509
Someone took care of them.

402
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,220
We found them out at McBain's place.

403
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:09,015
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

404
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,144
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

405
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,241
First three, then two.

406
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:42,131
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

407
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:46,969
And you're the one
who doesn't keep them.

408
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,348
What do you want?

409
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:52,975
Who are you?

410
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:57,897
Dave Jenkins.

411
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,658
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

412
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,702
Calder Benson.

413
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:16,040
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

414
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:20,127
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

415
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:21,545
You killed him.

416
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:23,422
Who are you?

417
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,883
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

418
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,470
The woman.

419
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,557
We're only losing time.

420
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,398
All right.

421
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,651
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

422
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,320
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

423
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,244
Keep him warm for me.

424
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,913
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

425
01:28:56,248 --> 01:29:00,126
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

426
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,842
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

427
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,678
By the way, I want you to keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

428
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,096
- Understand?
- Sure, Frank.

429
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,358
- See anyone?
- No.

430
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,587
There he is.

431
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:54,878
You only know how to shoot?

432
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,674
Or do you know how to cut, too?

433
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:11,228
Hey, you.

434
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,232
Wait a minute.

435
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:18,610
Let's have a good look at you.

436
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,666
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.

437
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,228
It's easy to find you.

438
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:54,855
Bastard.

439
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,899
I don't have to kill you now.

440
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:59,777
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

441
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,363
Two beautiful shiny rails.

442
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,241
There's another bastard.

443
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,120
And he's getting further away
every minute.

444
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,050
There it is.

445
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,593
Exactly what your husband ordered
from me.

446
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:27,179
And seeing as how he paid cash
on the barrelhead,

447
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:28,806
it all belongs to you.

448
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,142
Oak planks, beech, pine.

449
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,269
All first-grade lumber.

450
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:37,064
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

451
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:41,443
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

452
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,862
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

453
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:45,823
Enlarge the farmhouse?

454
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:49,201
He could have built
at least eight of them.

455
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,953
By the way, ma'am,

456
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,832
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

457
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:59,128
Only it seems he forgot to tell me
what he wanted printed on it.

458
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:08,303
Station.

459
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:10,973
How's that again?

460
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:13,350
I said print "station."

461
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,467
Looking for this?

462
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,888
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.

463
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,890
I know that woman is here.

464
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,018
I don't want any more useless killing.

465
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:59,438
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

466
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,481
To pay what's necessary.

467
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:04,067
I don't want to waste any more time.

468
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,237
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

469
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,829
When you're not on that train,
you look like a turtle out of its shell.

470
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:17,748
Just funny.

471
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:19,625
Poor cripple talking big

472
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:22,377
so nobody will know
how scared you are.

473
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,379
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

474
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,092
I don't have time to compete with you.

475
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,808
Compete?

476
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,564
Why, you...

477
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:45,901
You can't even stand
on your own feet by yourself.

478
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,289
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

479
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,751
I could squash you like a wormy apple.

480
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:08,257
Sure, but you won't do it.

481
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,636
Because it's not to your advantage.

482
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:22,813
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

483
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:34,241
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

484
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,080
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

485
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,082
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

486
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,001
Of course, it won't make
any difference to you

487
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:46,169
dealing with the new owner.

488
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:15,407
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

489
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:18,785
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank."

490
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:22,914
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."

491
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,208
And this one says "corral."

492
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,295
And this here "church."

493
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,756
What the hell is this?

494
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:32,549
Can't you see?

495
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:35,260
It's a station.

496
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,680
And all around it, a town.

497
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,268
Brett McBain's town.

498
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:47,898
Was he crazy!

499
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:51,485
Yeah, in a very special way.

500
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:54,446
An Irishman.

501
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:57,491
He knew, sooner or later,

502
01:39:57,575 --> 01:40:00,869
that railroad coming through Flagstone
would continue on west.

503
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,789
So he looked over
all this country out here

504
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:07,542
until he found this hunk of desert.

505
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,753
Nobody wanted it.

506
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,050
But he bought it.

507
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:22,349
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

508
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,644
Waited for what?

509
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:29,689
For the railroad to reach this point.

510
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,776
But how in the hell could he be sure

511
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,779
the railroad would pass
through his property?

512
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:40,033
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

513
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:45,122
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

514
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,290
Under this land.

515
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:50,836
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?

516
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:56,133
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

517
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,678
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

518
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:03,640
Brett McBain wanted his station.

519
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:08,478
He got the rights to build it.

520
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:13,400
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

521
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:16,778
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

522
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,239
One thing, though.

523
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:23,493
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

524
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:28,081
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

525
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:31,293
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,

526
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,838
the station ain't built yet.

527
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:45,932
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

528
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:48,226
Hey.

529
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,231
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

530
01:41:53,316 --> 01:41:57,736
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

531
01:41:58,196 --> 01:42:01,072
Yeah.

532
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:03,700
Listen.

533
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,994
Harmonica.

534
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:10,248
A town built around the railroad.

535
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:13,710
You could make a fortune, huh?

536
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:17,797
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

537
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:20,967
Hey, more than that.

538
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:24,346
Thousands of thousands.

539
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,724
They call them millions.

540
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:30,769
Millions?

541
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,650
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

542
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:40,987
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

543
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,532
All you gotta do is...

544
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:49,663
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?

545
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:52,332
But, chief, what are we supposed to do?

546
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,501
What are you supposed to do?

547
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:57,254
Build a station, idiots!

548
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:03,051
I figure it ain't gonna look like much.

549
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:10,016
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

550
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:12,894
If she gets back.

551
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:34,392
I think...

552
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:44,194
Yeah.

553
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:49,532
I'm beginning to think
I might be a little sorry killing you.

554
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,828
You like being alive.

555
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:10,804
You also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

556
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:14,224
You like it.

557
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:22,440
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

558
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:43,753
What a...

559
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:49,134
What a little tramp.

560
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:56,266
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

561
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:01,479
Nothing, Frank.

562
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:28,298
Now I understand
why they miss you so much

563
01:46:29,842 --> 01:46:33,720
down there in New Orleans.

564
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:38,975
Great invention, the telegraph.

565
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,231
"Jill? The brunette?

566
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:47,567
"My God, all the customers

567
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:50,236
"of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

568
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:53,323
"have been weeping ever since she left."

569
01:46:55,785 --> 01:46:57,243
Say, tell me.

570
01:46:58,746 --> 01:47:00,497
Did old McBain know?

571
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:02,499
Yeah.

572
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:05,752
Yeah, I bet he did.

573
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,005
He was just the type to marry a whore.

574
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:13,426
Hey.

575
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:16,638
It's an idea.

576
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:20,725
I could marry you.

577
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:24,479
And the land would become mine.

578
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:26,564
And maybe

579
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,486
you'd make a perfect wife.

580
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:39,577
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

581
01:47:40,955 --> 01:47:42,205
Too bad.

582
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:45,917
We'll have to think of another solution.

583
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:47,877
Simpler.

584
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:54,467
Quicker.

585
01:48:16,615 --> 01:48:18,783
As sheriff of this county,

586
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:22,287
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

587
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:26,916
of all property belonging
to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.

588
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:30,837
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

589
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:35,174
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

590
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:38,344
This property and all it contains,

591
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:40,680
lock, stock and barrel,

592
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:44,309
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

593
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:47,145
All the contents therein
are listed by number

594
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:50,148
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

595
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:54,152
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

596
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,778
All right. That's clear to everybody.

597
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,365
I declare the auction open.

598
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,493
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

599
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:11,252
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.

600
01:49:12,338 --> 01:49:15,965
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

601
01:49:19,929 --> 01:49:21,471
$200.

602
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,974
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

603
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:28,895
$200. Do I hear more?

604
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:31,731
That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.

605
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:32,941
Is it, old-timer?

606
01:49:33,025 --> 01:49:36,069
Come on, my friends, $200.

607
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:39,530
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

608
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:42,325
Well...

609
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:45,828
Who's going to bid $300?

610
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,584
Now, look, friends,

611
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,837
I realize we're not offering
California here,

612
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:58,174
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

613
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:02,345
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.

614
01:50:05,683 --> 01:50:09,102
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

615
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:20,488
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

616
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,993
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain,

617
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:28,037
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

618
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,505
All I want is to sell.

619
01:51:44,406 --> 01:51:47,158
- You look fat, huh?
- If you say so.

620
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:50,119
- How many?
- One card.

621
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:54,040
One for me.

622
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,711
Dealer takes three.

623
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:11,599
Can I... Can I take a hand?

624
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:19,398
Fifteen.

625
01:52:32,788 --> 01:52:34,747
Yeah, sit down.

626
01:52:58,438 --> 01:52:59,772
I'll deal.

627
01:54:44,962 --> 01:54:46,420
How do you...

628
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:50,508
How do you play this game, Mr. Morton?

629
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:54,845
It's very simple.

630
01:54:56,181 --> 01:55:00,726
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

631
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:10,194
$500.

632
01:55:12,364 --> 01:55:14,365
Do I hear any other bids?

633
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:18,411
I don't think so.

634
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:29,130
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain,

635
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:34,176
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

636
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:46,897
$500 once.

637
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:52,361
$500 twice.

638
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:57,825
- $500...
- $5,000.

639
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:26,020
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

640
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,826
It's Cheyenne!

641
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:53,672
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

642
01:56:54,091 --> 01:56:58,135
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

643
01:56:58,762 --> 01:57:01,263
There were no dollars in them days.

644
01:57:03,433 --> 01:57:05,768
But sons of bitches, yeah.

645
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:22,034
Hey, wait a minute.

646
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:26,914
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

647
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:30,709
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

648
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:34,296
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

649
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:36,424
They got a modern jail there.

650
01:57:36,758 --> 01:57:41,137
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

651
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:45,808
You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.

652
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:50,498
Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.

653
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:52,041
One way only.

654
01:58:54,836 --> 01:58:57,671
Here's to you. And congratulations.

655
01:59:02,552 --> 01:59:04,762
You got yourself a good deal.

656
01:59:06,223 --> 01:59:07,598
The auction.

657
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:12,144
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

658
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:19,235
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenseless widows.

659
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:22,738
But then again,

660
01:59:25,617 --> 01:59:28,744
I don't look like
a poor defenseless widow.

661
01:59:35,585 --> 01:59:37,795
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

662
01:59:39,798 --> 01:59:41,882
And you're a remarkable man.

663
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:45,261
But you have something on your mind.

664
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:53,143
And you got something on your mind.

665
01:59:56,815 --> 02:00:00,776
Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.

666
02:00:19,504 --> 02:00:22,214
I think it's time I filled that bathtub.

667
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,371
Who are you?

668
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:17,353
Jim Cooper.

669
02:01:18,355 --> 02:01:20,022
Chuck Youngblood.

670
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:22,524
More dead men.

671
02:01:26,363 --> 02:01:29,365
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

672
02:01:35,622 --> 02:01:38,791
You paid $5,000 for something
that belongs to me.

673
02:01:44,005 --> 02:01:45,172
5,000.

674
02:01:50,303 --> 02:01:52,221
Plus one.

675
02:01:57,769 --> 02:01:59,978
You've got a right to make a profit, too.

676
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:30,175
I wouldn't take too long thinking about it,
if I were you.

677
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:37,349
You got yourself into something
that's bigger than you are.

678
02:02:37,434 --> 02:02:40,102
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

679
02:02:40,562 --> 02:02:43,272
You sound like
a real businessman, Frank.

680
02:02:44,107 --> 02:02:47,317
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

681
02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:56,827
And you've learned some new methods.

682
02:02:59,164 --> 02:03:02,082
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you
a lot of new ways.

683
02:03:06,838 --> 02:03:09,465
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

684
02:03:10,717 --> 02:03:13,635
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

685
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:18,098
Which deal, Frank?

686
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:23,061
We have more than one, you and me.

687
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:32,404
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

688
02:03:33,031 --> 02:03:34,490
Here and now.

689
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:38,494
Easy, Frank.

690
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:40,287
Easy.

691
02:03:41,456 --> 02:03:43,624
You gotta learn not to push things.

692
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:46,835
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

693
02:03:50,173 --> 02:03:53,842
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

694
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,139
How much?

695
02:04:00,517 --> 02:04:01,850
$1.

696
02:05:06,958 --> 02:06:44,346
Giddy up!

697
02:07:48,536 --> 02:07:51,204
I could swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

698
02:07:51,289 --> 02:07:52,622
Right now.

699
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:46,987
Time sure flies.

700
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:50,574
It's already past 12:00.

701
02:10:50,218 --> 02:10:52,594
But... But they were his men.

702
02:10:52,678 --> 02:10:55,096
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

703
02:10:55,556 --> 02:10:57,432
They must have found somebody
who pays better.

704
02:10:57,516 --> 02:10:58,558
And you!

705
02:10:58,976 --> 02:11:00,852
You saved his life.

706
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:06,608
I didn't let them kill him
and that's not the same thing.

707
02:11:19,455 --> 02:11:20,872
Sure.

708
02:11:21,457 --> 02:11:23,917
It's not the same thing.

709
02:11:31,259 --> 02:11:32,842
You get dressed.

710
02:11:33,261 --> 02:11:34,678
It's time to go home.

711
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:56,040
Did you make coffee?

712
02:16:57,585 --> 02:16:59,168
This time I did.

713
02:17:39,668 --> 02:17:40,752
Good.

714
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:46,507
My mother used to make
coffee this way.

715
02:17:47,343 --> 02:17:52,013
Hot, strong and good.

716
02:18:01,523 --> 02:18:03,191
Cheyenne.

717
02:18:05,402 --> 02:18:07,737
What's he waiting for out there?

718
02:18:10,366 --> 02:18:11,491
What's he doing?

719
02:18:17,498 --> 02:18:19,916
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

720
02:18:22,461 --> 02:18:25,171
I got a feeling when he stops whittling,

721
02:18:26,632 --> 02:18:30,927
something's gonna happen.

722
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:39,203
Surprised to see me here?

723
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:42,999
I knew you'd come.

724
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:09,692
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

725
02:20:11,028 --> 02:20:12,820
Now I understand why.

726
02:20:15,157 --> 02:20:19,494
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

727
02:20:20,662 --> 02:20:23,998
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

728
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:25,708
Just a man.

729
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,004
An ancient race.

730
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:40,681
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

731
02:20:41,058 --> 02:20:43,017
The future don't matter to us.

732
02:20:43,894 --> 02:20:45,102
Nothing matters now.

733
02:20:45,187 --> 02:20:48,523
Not the land, not the money,
not the woman.

734
02:20:49,149 --> 02:20:51,025
I came here to see you.

735
02:20:53,612 --> 02:20:56,697
'Cause I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

736
02:21:12,005 --> 02:21:14,090
Only at the point of dying.

737
02:21:17,427 --> 02:21:18,636
I know.

738
02:22:03,307 --> 02:22:07,018
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

739
02:22:07,978 --> 02:22:10,104
Put it there, please.

740
02:22:12,524 --> 02:22:16,235
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

741
02:22:22,743 --> 02:22:24,118
You know what?

742
02:22:25,912 --> 02:22:28,581
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

743
02:22:38,216 --> 02:22:39,842
You can't imagine

744
02:22:41,136 --> 02:22:44,305
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

745
02:22:46,767 --> 02:22:48,517
Just to look at her.

746
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:55,483
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

747
02:22:57,527 --> 02:23:00,154
just make believe it's nothing.

748
02:23:03,116 --> 02:23:04,659
They earned it.

749
02:27:38,934 --> 02:27:41,268
Keep your loving brother happy.

750
02:31:00,218 --> 02:31:02,636
Who... Who are you?

751
02:32:10,413 --> 02:32:14,249
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

752
02:32:17,378 --> 02:32:19,421
But I'm not the right man.

753
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:33,977
And neither is he.

754
02:32:36,814 --> 02:32:38,148
Maybe not.

755
02:32:38,733 --> 02:32:40,234
But it doesn't matter.

756
02:32:44,614 --> 02:32:46,740
You don't understand, Jill.

757
02:32:48,284 --> 02:32:51,245
People like that have something inside.

758
02:32:53,581 --> 02:32:55,874
Something to do with death.

759
02:32:59,254 --> 02:33:03,423
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

760
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:06,593
pick up his gear and say adiós.

761
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:14,977
It would be nice to see this town grow.

762
02:34:47,028 --> 02:34:48,362
Now I gotta go.

763
02:35:34,659 --> 02:35:38,245
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

764
02:35:42,917 --> 02:35:45,252
I hope you'll come back someday.

765
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,271
Someday.

766
02:36:16,659 --> 02:36:20,537
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

767
02:36:46,481 --> 02:36:48,523
Make believe it's nothing.

768
02:38:54,108 --> 02:38:55,775
Sorry, Harmonica.

769
02:38:56,319 --> 02:38:58,320
I gotta stay here.

770
02:39:36,901 --> 02:39:37,984
Who?

771
02:39:41,697 --> 02:39:43,698
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

772
02:39:44,742 --> 02:39:48,161
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

773
02:39:48,996 --> 02:39:50,997
He got scared.

774
02:40:09,475 --> 02:40:11,017
Hey, Harmonica.

775
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:14,270
When they do you in,

776
02:40:15,022 --> 02:40:17,524
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

777
02:40:33,374 --> 02:40:38,795
Go away.

778
02:40:39,505 --> 02:40:42,549
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
