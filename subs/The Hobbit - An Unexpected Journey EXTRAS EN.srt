00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,796
Hello. Welcome to the first of our blogs
on the making of The Hobbit.

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,008
It's amazing to be back here again.
This is Bag-end...

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,010
...exactly as it was
in The Lord of the Rings...

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,721
...and it was actually built in our B stage
here in Wellington...

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,141
...which is exactly the same stage
as it was built 1 2 years ago.

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,934
We've been shooting for a few days now...

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,186
...and I just wanted to take
this opportunity...

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,731
...to give you a little look at the lead-up
to filming...

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,736
...and some of the preproduction
that led up to the first day of our shoot.

10
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,822
I look forward to keeping you up-to-date
as we go through the next...

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,991
...two or three years.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,076
See you soon.

13
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,997
Oh, you're in 3D. Looking good.

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,206
See you.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,462
And this pulls beautifully.

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,257
-This looks great when it's drawn.
-Yeah. So it actually works?

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,594
And he can also go fighting
with the remnants...

18
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,056
...sort of hanging onto his body
and be impaling people.

19
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,530
MAN: We wanted to create
a very non-human shape.

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,500
JACKSON:
We do need to do a little blog.

21
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,668
You might want to say hi
to the fans of The Hobbit.

22
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,170
Hi to the fans.

23
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,047
-See you.
JACKSON: Yeah.

24
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,424
Shy artists.

25
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,676
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

26
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,054
So we're, uh, going up to Wardrobe...

27
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:42,351
...and we're having a look at a couple
of Dwarf, uh, wardrobe and makeup fittings...

28
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,685
...which is always exciting.

29
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,855
Not that we'll show you much
in this particular blog...

30
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,774
...because we'll save that for the future...

31
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,860
...but at least you'll get to see a little bit
of our Wardrobe Department.

32
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:56,448
A lot of very busy people
working on a lot of costumes.

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,577
A lot of interesting textures and detail
and leather and embossing...

34
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,746
...and it's all pretty cool up here.

35
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:09,545
It's like a sort of a big wizard's workshop.

36
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,047
-Hello.
-Hello.

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,841
JACKSON:
Oh, my God. Hello.

38
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,596
JACKSON:
You can use it like a mace.

39
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,807
You can just swing and knock it
and cut the throat...

40
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,183
...and whack away at the stuff.

41
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,270
MAN: Lynn was saying there's a nice bit
where he just goes, drr!

42
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,689
-And take out about ten Orcs.
-Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,857
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,867
Now, this is a familiar set.
It's Elrond's chambers.

45
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:44,371
And it's an exact copy of the one that we had
in The Fellowship of the Ring.

46
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,418
In fact, just over here on the balcony
is where the Council of Elrond took place...

47
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:56,425
...where the fellowship was formed and Frodo
volunteered to take the ring to Mordor.

48
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,511
But also in The Hobbit, there's gonna be
a lot of new bits of Rivendell...

49
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,888
...that we haven't seen before.

50
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,348
Some really cool bits of Rivendell,
actually...

51
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,727
...that we'll keep as a little surprise
for the time being.

52
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,355
Now, there's an old friend upstairs.
Let's just have a quick look.

53
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,154
Here we are. l'm sure you'll recognize
the statue where Narsil...

54
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,948
...the broken sword, sits.

55
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:24,119
And, of course, in the time of The Hobbit,
the sword is gonna be here.

56
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,373
And it is strange walking around here...

57
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,793
...because it was, you know,
1 0 or 1 1 years ago.

58
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,922
And I'm used to looking at a set
like this on film, you know...

59
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,840
...and now we're walking back into it again.

60
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,720
It's almost like you've stepped inside
a movie. lt's a very weird experience.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,847
When we have a door blocked off....

62
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,515
This is where we're gonna be shooting.

63
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,519
At the very beginning of our shoot,
it's the Goblin tunnels...

64
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,231
...below the Misty Mountains.

65
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,525
It's a very iconic scene in The Hobbit...

66
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,238
...where Bilbo has an encounter with....

67
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,825
Well, you know who it's with, don't you,
if you've read The Hobbit?

68
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,954
No need to spoil it for anybody that hasn't.

69
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,248
But, uh, this is like a little network of caves.

70
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,793
Look, there's a whole other little set
of passageways down here.

71
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,629
It's very, um, claustrophobic.

72
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,341
But one of the things we've done in order
to be able to shoot the shots is to make sure...

73
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,178
...that all the different walls of the cave
can be removed...

74
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:27,015
...so that our big, bulky cameras can
actually shoot the angles that we need.

75
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,645
Oh, my God. Look at this thing here.

76
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,232
That looks like a foot or an arm.

77
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,776
Oh. I don't know.

78
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,071
That looks rather creepy, doesn't it? Ugh.

79
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,531
Okay.

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,370
JACKSON:
So how many chairs do we need?

81
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,789
For instance, should we...?

82
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,708
I reckon Bombur sits at the end.

83
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,336
And then there's a slight grapple.
And then when you pop down, it's like:

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,008
-And then it's like....
-That's it. Sorry, hate to interrupt.

85
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,385
-Now l know it's sort of safe. l can interrupt.
-Yeah.

86
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,137
This is blocking.

87
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,306
This is not really rehearsing,
but we're kind of....

88
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,684
The actors are walking through, and we're
talking about what to do with the scene.

89
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,271
It's actually fun, because it means when
we come to shoot this, we've got a plan.

90
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,066
It'd be good if you come forward, and then
you realize there's something on your foot.

91
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,779
And perhaps you try to get rid of it at first,
you know? And then you kind of....

92
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,072
This will be fun.

93
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,575
This will be more fun
when everybody's in makeup...

94
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,869
...and costumes and dying of the heat.

95
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,246
And sort of on the corner of the table
we've got Kili.

96
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,165
-Awesome.
JACKSON: Next to Kili, Fili.

97
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,375
-And then Dori.
WOMAN: Dori.

98
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,419
Dori and then Nori.

99
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,254
Oh, my God. Ori, Dori, Nori.

100
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,798
-Bifur, Bombur.... Gloin, Oin....
-Heh, heh, heh.

101
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,760
Nori, Dori, Nori. This is a nightmare.

102
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,386
We'll have Gandalf here and Thorin.

103
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:50,682
So I thought it would be good to give you
this whole doorway to play, and be kind of....

104
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,768
The fire will be blazing as well.

105
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,481
MAN:
Oh, is it? Oh, I see.

106
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,903
Well, my prediction is it's all going to go
incredibly well on the day.

107
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,072
Don't you agree?

108
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,909
Um....

109
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,744
The tricky thing is...

110
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,289
...that there are 1 3 Dwarves on this set.

111
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,584
The good news is
you're not in a fat suit.

112
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,919
No, no, no.

113
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,589
I am in a nose and false eyebrows,
a wig, a mustache and a beard...

114
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,216
...but you're right. No fat suit.

115
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,425
MAN:
You're way ahead.

116
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,762
Yeah. You're a winner.
You're a winner every step of the way.

117
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,682
And we can stick a fan up your robe
just to sort of give you a bit of air-conditioning.

118
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,185
-Promises, promises.
-Ha, ha, ha.

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,065
Well, that's gonna work.
With a little bit of finessing, that's gonna work.

120
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,575
MAN: Morning.
-Morning.

121
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,369
MAN: Morning.
-Morning. How are you?

122
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,787
MAN:
Morning.

123
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,707
So I'm officially the first person
in the makeup chair on The Hobbit.

124
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,793
Officially. Ha, ha, ha.

125
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,837
That's amazing. That's amazing.

126
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,486
ARMlTAGE:

127
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,999
My name is Richard.
I'm from London, England.

128
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,759
I would like to give thanks on behalf
of everyone here as visitors...

129
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:55,807
...for this ceremony, for this celebration,
for the blessing of the sound stage...

130
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,935
...and for the welcome that you offer to us.

131
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,688
We're all deeply honored to be here.

132
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:06,776
And to everyone that has waited so long
for this day...

133
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:11,490
...to begin this extraordinary journey,
filming The Hobbit...

134
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:17,662
...I would like to wish them good luck,
good health and good harmony.

135
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,832
Um, Martin would like to say something.

136
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,587
Thank you. My name's Martin Freeman.
I'm in the cast as well.

137
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,340
Uh, he stole everything l was about to say
in Maori.

138
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,844
As Richard said,
this has been a long time coming today.

139
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,806
It's been even longer
than we thought it was gonna be.

140
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,685
So I hope at the end of this journey
we are all as close with each other...

141
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,480
...as, at the moment,
we have the potential to be.

142
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,858
So thank you very much.

143
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,613
Eh, hello, everybody. l'm Andy Serkis.

144
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:56,493
I am standing up just to say on behalf
of the returning crew and cast...

145
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,872
...who have gathered here
to go on the journey.

146
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,168
And we're just very, very grateful
to your incredible hospitality...

147
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,255
...and to have the opportunity
to share the passion...

148
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,882
...for telling such an amazing,
amazing story...

149
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,053
...in such an amazing country
with such beautiful people. Thank you.

150
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,186
You know, for a long time l thought that
going back to the amazing experience...

151
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,565
...of Lord of the Rings
wouldn't be a good idea.

152
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:31,152
Um, but really, you know,
now l've come completely around...

153
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,155
...because films are stressful
and they're hard to make...

154
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,201
...but, ultimately, what makes them fun
is the people that you work with.

155
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:43,331
And the fact that, you know, we're gonna
be working with a lot of the old gang...

156
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,874
...with a lot of friends...

157
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:49,045
...and obviously making some new friends,
is really the point of being here.

158
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,548
So I'm extremely thrilled.

159
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,468
If somebody came up to me today and said
that we could carry on preproduction...

160
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,346
...for another six weeks, l'd say, "No, no.

161
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,348
Hell, no. Let's just start shooting."

162
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,236
WOMAN:
And roll sound.

163
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,488
And action.

164
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,662
NARRATOR:
In a hole in the ground...

165
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,123
...there lived a Hobbit.

166
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,096
JACKSON:
Sky darkens.

167
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,100
And flames.

168
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,311
And cut.

169
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,520
That's great.

170
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,064
Good.

171
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,024
That's fabbo. Fabbo, fabbo, fabbo.

172
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,233
Thank you very, very much.

173
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,526
Yay!

174
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,861
That's the one.

175
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,073
Well, thank you very much, everybody,
for a great first block.

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,284
And have a great break.
Everyone's having a break.

177
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,870
And we will see you back here soon enough.

178
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,083
Ladies and gentlemen of the second unit,
that is a wrap on block one.

179
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,427
We're just gonna get, uh, one more pickup
in Bag-end.

180
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,472
-Hello.
JACKSON: Yep. Come in.

181
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,974
-And so-- Hi, Pete. How you doing?
-Hey, Andy. Come in.

182
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,727
Just wanted to do one more pickup in here,
if that was all right.

183
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,938
What's this?
Oh, this is the video blog pickup.

184
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,482
-Yeah.
-That's right. They're going into block one.

185
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,818
Anyway, um, we just wanted to say hi
to everybody...

186
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,112
...because we haven't done one
of these video blogs...

187
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,114
...since the beginning of the shoot.

188
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,116
-God, it feels like a lifetime.
-I know.

189
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,537
Ha, ha. Because you-- The first week
of shooting we did with Andy as Gollum.

190
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,582
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it! Ha!

191
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,919
You weren't a second-unit director
in those days. You were an actor.

192
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,005
-You were an old-fashioned--
-Now l've crossed over to the dark side.

193
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,050
-You've now gone to the dark side.
SERKlS: l'm wiped, I'm actually--

194
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,510
I'm absolutely wiped.

195
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,429
-That's all yours.
-Is it?

196
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,930
-Okay.
-Just give us a good battle.

197
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,057
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

198
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,310
-I don't know how you do it. It's....
-Ha, ha.

199
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,313
You're getting tired. l always tell people
I get exhausted...

200
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,568
...at the end of the first couple of days
and stay exhausted till it finishes.

201
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,656
Yeah, we have 250 days of shooting
on these two hobbit movies...

202
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,326
...and I think it's a much better way
to divide that up into three blocks...

203
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,079
...and then have some time
to edit what you've done...

204
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,041
...look at it, hand visual-effects shots
over to the CGI guys.

205
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,461
You can really focus on the script revisions.

206
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,589
It's a much smarter way
to shoot these big films.

207
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,507
SERKlS:
Yeah, on something of this scale too.

208
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,010
I mean, when we were given our T-shirts,
we said:

209
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,180
"Fifty-four days down, 200 to go."

210
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,058
I have to admit, l don't know how great it was.
"Please wear these on set tomorrow."

211
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,644
It wasn't exactly a morale-boosting moment,
was it?

212
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,689
Everywhere you turn, on the people's backs
was "200 days to go."

213
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,193
It was like, "Oh, God."
I felt tired before lunch, you know?

214
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,154
WOMAN: The good news is that it's over.
The first day back is Monday...

215
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,363
...the fifth of September.

216
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,283
So thank you, guys.
It's been a pleasure having you with us.

217
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,786
MAN: Where are you guys off to
during the break?

218
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,915
My wife and I, my lovely wife, Aileen,
we've got a holiday...

219
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,334
...in the South lsland of New Zealand.

220
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:19,756
And my lovely, gorgeous wife, Nicole,
and I are just gonna work on the house.

221
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,509
I'm leaving shortly after talking to you...

222
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,929
...for London, which is a long journey, uh...

223
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,222
...by plane.

224
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,100
And once there, l immediately go into
production of a play l'm going to do...

225
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,560
...by Eduardo De Filippo.

226
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,605
I'm going to America, to Pebble Beach...

227
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,273
...in a week to play some golf.

228
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,777
Work on my tan so l can freak
the makeup people out when I come back.

229
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,278
I'm having a break.

230
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,447
Ha, ha. l'm having four weeks off.

231
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:49,285
-Sleeping in. My favorite hobby.
-To Australia to see our daughter.

232
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,372
-I'm gonna run a marathon.
-I'm gonna attempt...

233
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,625
...to write and record
a psychedelic, sledge-rock album.

234
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,002
Hitting the fabric shops in central London.

235
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,339
-I go home to Thailand tomorrow.
-To Barcelona.

236
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,677
-To meet, talk to fans from Spain.
-Bali for 1 1 days.

237
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:10,431
-London and Paris to see friends.
-Manhattan Beach. It's closest to the airport.

238
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,269
I haven't been home
for the last three years back in Belgium...

239
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,770
...so my mom is cracking the whip.

240
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,940
And then I'm going Vegas
and spend all my hard-earned cash.

241
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,025
Do some more swimming and lots of golf.
Pssh!

242
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,862
Probably getting a little bit drunk.
A little bit on a holiday.

243
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,906
I'm looking forward to getting
on the drink...

244
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,410
...where l'm not gonna get a bad reputation
because they already know what l'm like.

245
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,789
And now l'm going back to Ireland
to see my family and see some of my mates...

246
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,126
...in Belfast for a quiet little weekend.

247
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,670
I hope no one phones me
for about three weeks at least.

248
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,173
Come back refreshed
and ready to rock on the next lot.

249
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,968
MAN: What are you doing on break?
-Well, I'm going back home...

250
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,095
...to maybe have a little bit of time off...

251
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,805
...to go home and live with the family.

252
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,433
And then, really, before you know it,
I'll be back.

253
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,893
It's weird, because you get to this point...

254
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,104
...when you're at the end
of a block of shooting...

255
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,982
...and it almost feels
like you're going on vacation, but it's not...

256
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,902
...because on Monday morning,
I'm in the cutting room, editing...

257
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,406
...and I've got to have meetings with Alan
and John and Dan about designing stuff...

258
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,118
...for the second block and with Richard
Taylor about all the things he has to build.

259
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,121
So in some respects,
I'm back into preproduction again.

260
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,291
But also l'm in postproduction
because l'm editing.

261
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,835
Plus we're in production
because we're shooting these movies.

262
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,755
It's like being in preproduction, production,
and postproduction.

263
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,548
It kind of gets a bit screwy.

264
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,218
But before l get to do any of that, l've got
to jump on a plane tomorrow morning...

265
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,554
...and go location scouting
down in the South lsland.

266
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,558
-Take some good pictures. Ha, ha.
-I will. I'll take some good pictures.

267
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,829
Since we're gonna be doing location shooting
during our next block of shooting...

268
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,374
...it's really time to have
to nail everything down.

269
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,711
On the recce, there'll be....
It's usually about 1 7 of us that go.

270
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,881
We get around in five helicopters usually.

271
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,009
It's quite a spectacle when we turn up.

272
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,472
Peter, Caro, Zane, Brigitte,
Andrew, Dan Hennah...

273
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,516
...Simon Bright, the art director...

274
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:21,270
...Steve lngram, John Howe, Alan Lee,
Eric Saindon.

275
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,023
We have Tony Keddy, the grip,
Reg Garside, the gaffer...

276
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,193
...and myself,
location scout Dave Comer joins us...

277
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,947
...and Peter's assistant, Sebastian.
The ever-faithful Sebastian is there.

278
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,992
Here on the mountains l put my hand out,
and a cup of tea slides into it.

279
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,661
That's what we like.

280
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,998
There's even a Starbucks up here
in the Southern Alps.

281
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,755
Slippery, hard to walk and juggle a cup of tea
at the same time on this sort of--

282
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,257
Right. No mean feat.

283
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,931
JACKSON:
I never come prepared for these things.

284
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,143
I always somehow imagine it's gonna be dry
and warm and nice.

285
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,396
At least it's not raining.

286
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,900
We'll be not just scouting,
which is essentially searching for locations.

287
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,862
We're now returning to the locations
that we liked...

288
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,031
...and we're gonna start
to talk about the logistics.

289
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,994
You don't think by the time you've helicoptered
everybody in and you've got to helicopter out.

290
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,663
You're not actually here
early morning or late afternoon.

291
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,333
-No, right. You're here middle of the day.
-It's all broad daytime.

292
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,086
-Unless you camp out here.
-Well, that-- Yeah.

293
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,633
CONNON: On set, we are allowing
approximately half a rugby field...

294
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,303
...for the essential equipment trucks...

295
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,223
...and then our crew parking
and also unit-based parking...

296
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,726
...which is where all our makeup
and costume facilities are.

297
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,395
If you make a path along the edge
of the swamp....

298
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,775
In essence, we need to create space
for two rugby fields of equipment.

299
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,196
JACKSON: lt's weird on locations because
you're standing in the middle of a mountain...

300
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,989
...or a valley or some beautiful place...

301
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,409
...and you're having to figure out,
"Where are we gonna put the crew tents?

302
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,412
Where are people gonna get changed?
Where are the Port-A-Loos gonna go?"

303
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,415
Because all that stuff has to be where
you're not gonna point the camera.

304
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,252
You can have Gandalf and the Dwarves
all running up over this brow here...

305
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,630
...and scurrying,
hiding behind these rocks.

306
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,548
Just as they get there, you crane up....

307
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,967
The last thing you want to find out
in six months' time...

308
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,971
...is you're standing on this beautiful mountain
and saying, "This is exactly the shot I want"...

309
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,183
...and you find you've got 20 Port-A-Loos
right in front of the camera.

310
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,311
That's not what you want to do.
So you've got to figure all that stuff out.

311
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,189
We've got to keep looking.
Sooner rather than later, isn't it?

312
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,398
Yup.

313
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,870
We'll be flying--
I don't know, maybe 30 locations probably.

314
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,748
CONNON: We're shooting locations
around the Mackenzie country...

315
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,293
...around wilder landscapes,
below Mount Cook.

316
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,674
And we will also be shooting
around Dunedin way.

317
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,010
More beautiful stone, rock,
you know, wild country.

318
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,722
And that's quite exciting because it's an area
of Middle-earth we haven't visited before.

319
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,725
That big rock could be part of a house,
couldn't it?

320
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,854
We're scouting presently
for the ancient Mirkwood.

321
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,730
And the Anduin grasslands...

322
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,315
...is south of Queenstown.

323
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,818
MAN 1 : lt's pretty incredible.
MAN 2: Anyone shooting that?

324
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,778
CONNON:
We're still trying to work out...

325
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,739
...how we're going to shoot Lonely Mountain,
Misty Mountain pass.

326
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,411
Lonely Mountain should be by itself.
If you can look over in that direction there.

327
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,205
CONNON: There's still a few rivers
that we're scouting for.

328
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,379
You know, I think we're getting pretty close
to photographing every decent river...

329
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,630
...in New Zealand now.

330
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,219
It would be quite funny to have 1 3 barrels
all in the middle of this thing.

331
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,598
Yeah, with a guy shouting,
"Come on. Get on with it.

332
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,933
Come on. Move ahead. Go faster."

333
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,020
Is it a floater? lt's quite heavy.

334
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,447
CONNON: We're gonna go
to some reasonably remote places.

335
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,992
Sometimes places that, you know,
very, very few people have seen.

336
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,037
JACKSON: There's plenty of New Zealand
that we haven't seen yet.

337
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,956
I think people think
it's such a small country...

338
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,293
...and Lord ofthe Rings, we saw so much of it
that we must have seen everything.

339
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,753
But believe me, we haven't.

340
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,006
There's a huge amount
of wonderful locations still to come.

341
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,884
-What a pretty spot, isn't it?
-That's a great spot.

342
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,303
Well, we'll say goodbye for now...

343
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,264
...and hopefully you've enjoyed this update.

344
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:29,352
And there may well be another one
coming during the break sometime.

345
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,647
So keep your eye out for that.

346
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,547
Hello and welcome to our next video blog.

347
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,051
I thought it would be good to carry on
talking to Andy Serkis...

348
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:07,932
...about some of the fun and games
we had during our first block of shooting.

349
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,017
Andy.

350
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,815
Andy? Where is he?

351
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,320
Andy?

352
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,865
What is this place? This isn't Wellington.

353
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,620
Where am l?

354
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:36,293
Isn't this where James Bond
crashed his Aston Martin in 1 964?

355
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,427
And isn't this where Red Grant
trained to be an assassin...

356
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,762
...at the beginning of
From Russia with Love?

357
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,612
You know what?
I think we should run the blog anyway.

358
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,868
So, what we did is we asked cast and crew
to tell us a few of their favorite memories...

359
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,288
...from the first three or four months
of shooting.

360
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,708
So please enjoy that,
and I'll go figure out where l am.

361
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,844
MAN: What are things that stand out for you
the most from the first block?

362
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:31,223
For me, my favorite stuff we've done so far
has been Gollum's cave.

363
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,560
GOLLUM:
What was that, precious? Shh.

364
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,606
The way that Pete did that scene,
it felt like l was watching a play.

365
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,651
It was sort of like you could sit back and
watch these amazing guys do their thing.

366
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,654
Him and Martin together were fantastic.
It was really cool.

367
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,532
Time's up.

368
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,701
SERKlS:
Trying to get back into the head of Gollum.

369
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,288
Don't know if I ever told you,
it felt like an impersonation...

370
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,874
-...of a character that I played.
-Ha, ha.

371
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,375
-Yes.
-It was weird.

372
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,920
Because it was like
having to re-own it again.

373
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,130
No!

374
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,673
-It was cool.
-Nice way of starting.

375
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,843
I felt sorry for Martin because he was
suddenly thrust into having to find...

376
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,806
...the character of Bilbo and have
to deal with you for a whole week...

377
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,434
...going at him the whole time.
It must have been intimidating.

378
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,187
Bless us and splash us.

379
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,897
That's a meaty mouthful.

380
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,651
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

381
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,446
It's gonna be a good movie. Check it out.

382
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:31,700
After two years of, "My God,
are we ever going to shoot this film?"...

383
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,996
...we had 1 3 Dwarves and a Hobbit.
Might have had a wizard as well.

384
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,998
Suddenly, it's real.

385
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,501
-Seeing the sets were, like, amazing.
-True.

386
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,756
Coming to Bag-end and walking through.
This was our first day, wasn't it?

387
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,259
-It was.
-First day on the job. That was amazing.

388
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,929
MAN: Can you name them?
-Name the Dwarves?

389
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,348
Ori, Dori, Nori. Bifur, Bof--

390
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,725
Bifur, Bombur, Bofur, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin--

391
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,395
Can't even remember who they are.

392
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,482
-You have Fili and Kili.
McKELLEN: There's Thorin and there's Gloin...

393
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,527
...and there's Oin and Dwalin and Balin.

394
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,446
And there's Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur...

395
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,075
...and then there are the three,
Dori, Nori, and Ori. I think that's it, isn't it?

396
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,036
MAN:
Jesus, l can't remember.

397
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,288
I think so.

398
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:21,000
Thirteen Dwarves is one of the reasons
why l dreaded The Hobbit...

399
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,753
...and why l really didn't think
I was gonna make it for such a long time.

400
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,715
The irony is it's turned out to be
one of the joys of the film.

401
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,884
MAN:
Oh, my God.

402
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:39,310
McKELLEN: What a challenge.
I mean, 1 3 heroes. Or 14 with Bilbo.

403
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,063
They all have to be differentiated in a way
that isn't necessary in the book...

404
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,193
...but if you keep seeing them,
you want to know who they are specifically.

405
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,528
What their attitude is
and why they're on this journey.

406
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,572
We need to move now!

407
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,781
Come on!

408
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:57,077
Some of the best memories were, um,
getting the Dwarves ready.

409
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,414
Everybody has helped these actors
kind of find their way through...

410
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,959
...lots of rubber and lots of hair. Heh.

411
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,463
JED: Walking through Weta and getting to see
our designs and going, "Actually, God...

412
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,548
...I look amazing.
The most amazing of anyone."

413
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:13,010
-That was probably the best day, wasn't it?
-Mm-hm. Yeah.

414
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,138
-When you all said Jed is amazing.
-We did. Yeah.

415
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,475
NESBlTT: Some looked bad
before they got into prosthetics.

416
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,353
In fact, for some,
a prosthetic is making them look better...

417
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,149
...to tell you the truth, which says something.
Mark Hadlow, for example, springs to mind.

418
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:31,362
I have this lovely bit down here, and then
this mustache that comes up here.

419
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,657
I look stunning. l should be in centerfold.

420
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,911
One of the things that early on
we discovered was that Mark Hadlow...

421
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,372
...uh, likes to dress up in costumes.

422
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,167
Um, mainly sort of military-type things.

423
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,921
And the really weird thing
about his sailor outfits...

424
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,758
...is that, um, below the waist, nothing.

425
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,135
-Bag-end, you know--
-He's a nice bloke, though.

426
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,846
-A little bit to come. A little bit to come.
-Little bit to come.

427
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,682
MAN:
One of them doesn't wear a beard.

428
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,976
Yeah, well, we are all very,
very jealous of that.

429
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,520
NESBlTT: Actually, he is-- Aidan Turner.
He's the sexy Dwarf.

430
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,189
I don't even think
he's even got a beard, actually.

431
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,316
Mainly because he's not old enough
to grow one.

432
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,069
He's the hot one, I suppose,
if you like that kind of thing.

433
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,698
But if you like knitted cardigans
and knitted mittens...

434
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,574
-...then l'm your fellow.
-Ha, ha.

435
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,910
HUNTER: lf there was a boy band
in Middle-earth...

436
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:24,456
...he'd be the leader or the Robbie Williams
of the Dwarf world.

437
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,041
-Whereas you'd be...?
-A roadie.

438
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,043
I think Bombur would be a roadie.

439
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,504
HAMBLETON:
I think when people see the beards...

440
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,215
...beards are gonna come back in big time.

441
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,509
Give us a kiss.

442
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,310
We've all learned, uh,
a bit of the Dwarf language, Khuzdul.

443
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:50,399
So we all have a selection of words
to fall back on, um, curses and battle cries.

444
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,610
We speak Dwarvish to each other
most of the time when we're on set.

445
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,195
Okay. Here it goes. Ahem.

446
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,240
And Peter can guess what it is,
and then I'll tell people.

447
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,208
Peter?

448
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:12,504
-Uh....
-It means "mighty Dwarf."

449
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,971
SERKlS: We had done Trollshaw.
-You got to do all the fun stuff in Trollshaw.

450
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,639
Yeah, we did.

451
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:28,354
I had to shoot dialogue and things.
He got to do all the good fighting-troll stuff.

452
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,648
Great thing about the Dwarves is that
even though there's this comic element...

453
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,610
...to some of the characters,
not all of them, but some of them...

454
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,612
...when they fight, they really fight.

455
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,492
We started with three months
of intense training. We did stunt fighting.

456
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,912
We did horse riding.
We did the gym four times a week.

457
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,832
-We did Dwarf movement intensely.
-Yes.

458
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,838
They were trying to get us a point
where they could actually kill us...

459
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,591
...and bring us back from the dead,
kill us, bring us back.

460
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,636
All the CPR and stuff like that
because that's what it'll be like on set.

461
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,515
-They did it by breaking us down.
HAMBLETON: Yeah.

462
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:10,312
They did it by essentially reducing us
to the absolute amoeba stage...

463
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,190
...and then building us up again
as Dwarves.

464
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,818
We've come through it as better Dwarves,
I feel.

465
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,444
-I do too.
-I mean...

466
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,572
...I know that William's
discovered his inner Dwarf.

467
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,950
-I have. We all have actually.
-It's a frightening thing.

468
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,577
But, um, it's just the job
that had to be done.

469
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,375
If I could say key moments, uh,
in block one...

470
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,628
...arriving in Rivendell and meeting Elrond
and dining at his table.

471
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,506
It feels like
you're stepping into Middle-earth.

472
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,591
There are some
who would not deem it wise.

473
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,135
What do you mean?

474
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,638
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.

475
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,517
I remember it now, but, whoo, later on....
Whoo.

476
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,104
I loved working with Hugo and Cate.
Back in Rivendell again.

477
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,400
-That was fantastic.
-Hello, hello. Welcome, welcome.

478
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:01,321
I still can't quite get over being on set
with lan as Gandalf and Cate Blanchett...

479
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,115
...with Galadriel, and Hugo as Elrond.

480
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,617
You just feel like you've stepped back
into a movie again.

481
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,327
Kind of weird.

482
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,289
-Is this a new one? This is different.
-Yeah, a different one.

483
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,167
High points really I think was...

484
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,170
...getting Cate Blanchett with a long train.

485
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,005
WOMAN 1 : Beautiful.
WOMAN 2: Cate, that's beautiful.

486
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,214
MAN:
Yeah, that is.

487
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,050
WOMAN 1 : They're all gonna want one.
-Just don't ask me to walk in it.

488
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,932
One thing I like is that we're getting a little
bit of the music into the movie. The songs.

489
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,144
Tolkien wrote quite a few songs
for The Hobbit.

490
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,979
NESBlTT:
I got to sing a song.

491
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,939
MAN:
You want to hum a few bars for us now?

492
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,525
Oh, it's a classic song.

493
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,404
You know, it's after, sort of, Cole Porter
and Gershwin, that type of thing.

494
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,908
There's an inn, there's an inn
There's a merry old inn beneath an old gray hill

495
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,118
He squeaked and sawed
And quickened the tune

496
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,496
While the landlord shook the man in the moon

497
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,498
''It's after 3," he said

498
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,086
I think it would be great if Dwalin
just yelled the whole thing.

499
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,217
You smell like a tipsy cat.

500
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,437
Whether l'll be singing at the Oscars
is a different matter...

501
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,814
...but hopefully some people might
sing it in the shower.

502
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,651
Excuse me.

503
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,780
I think this is a Peter Jackson question.

504
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,742
Which Dwarf would you like to invite
to dinner?

505
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,162
Well, you know, I wouldn't invite any of them,
except myself.

506
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,791
I'm afraid that their table manners
aren't the best.

507
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,544
You get your fist, and you do that.

508
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,379
They would not want Bifur over for dinner.

509
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,882
He would be, like, the bottom of the line.

510
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,343
Ori because he'd be very polite.

511
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,553
Excuse me.

512
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,889
It would be me, obviously,
because l cook.

513
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,891
Stephen Hunter does well
with bad table manners.

514
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,854
He just eats so-- Have you seen the size
of him? l mean, oh, good Lord. He's enormous.

515
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,649
I've tried to talk to him about cutting down
his cholesterol...

516
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,942
...and his butter intake.

517
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,112
I don't think you'd invite Nori
because he'd steal all the silverware.

518
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,697
You'd never have Graham McTavish...

519
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,866
...because he would sit and glare at you
and show his forearms.

520
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,660
NESBlTT:
Dwalin is a real warrior.

521
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,955
When he parties, he goes completely mad,
like so many Scottish people.

522
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,498
Here you go.

523
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:23,630
Ha, ha. Well, the words "kettle," "black,"
"calling," "pot" come to mind.

524
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,218
I don't think you'd invite any Dwarf
to dinner, actually.

525
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,848
I wouldn't have them all together though.
Not 1 3. Maybe a couple at a time. Ha, ha.

526
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,393
JACKSON: Special person to meet here.
John Rhys-Davies.

527
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,354
ALL: Yay!
JACKSON: lt was fun.

528
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,649
On one of the days we were in Bag-end
with the Dwarves that John Rhys-Davies...

529
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,942
-...came to visit.
-Oh, yeah?

530
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,404
And it was great to introduce him
not only to Gloin...

531
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,281
...who's his father in the story...

532
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,907
...but also to all the other Dwarves.

533
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,786
-Daddy!
-Hello, my boy.

534
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,208
Just like coming home to family.

535
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,670
JACKSON: l predicted what John would say,
and he pretty much said it word-for-word.

536
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:09,426
I could just imagine him saying,
"Oh, you poor bastards."

537
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:14,014
Ha, ha. And that's pretty much
what he went on to say.

538
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,474
RHYS-DAVIES:
You poor buggers.

539
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:19,978
When he gets you running up a hill
in full armor, you'll enjoy that.

540
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,107
Gosh, you are going to be spectacular...

541
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,570
...and you'll be chased by women
all around the world.

542
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,947
But only if you're in costume and makeup.

543
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,952
Okay. All right.

544
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,538
We've been here since January the 1 3th.

545
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:42,334
So, what is that? Five months.
We haven't even scratched the surface.

546
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,296
-Who are you doubling, Pete?
-I'm doubling Stanley Kubrick.

547
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:53,178
One of the biggest moments
was when we all put our gear on...

548
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,681
...and we all stood together...

549
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,726
...sort of looking around at each other
into the characters' faces.

550
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:03,021
To stand in a circle and look at the guys
that were going on the quest...

551
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,524
...I got a real tingle up my spine.

552
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,610
Lovely. Thank you. That's terrific.
I think we can check the gate on that.

553
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,325
Thank you very much. Thank you, guys.

554
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,452
Thanks, guys.
Thanks very much, that's terrific.

555
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,872
WOMAN:
Thank you, thank you.

556
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,166
JED: Bittersweet moment,
but it's time to leave.

557
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,920
Then driving off.

558
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,922
I'm waiting for somebody. Sorry.

559
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,967
-It could have been even--
-I know.

560
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,969
-Just go.
-Really?

561
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,679
Yeah. Just go.

562
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,888
You've had enough. Go.

563
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,807
-Are you wrapped?
-No, I'm not wrapped.

564
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,436
-They're keeping the good people.
-Okay. Go again. We'll go now.

565
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,812
Okay, we'll go now.

566
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,690
It's a bittersweet moment,
but it's time to leave.

567
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,197
Well, I hope you enjoyed that.

568
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,784
I don't know whether there will be any more,
because l have to find New Zealand.

569
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,997
Which l've lost. I think it's over here.

570
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,293
Who is that odd little fellow?

571
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,970
JACKSON:
Action.

572
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,892
Cut. Lovely.

573
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,894
Hi, welcome to our new blog.

574
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,314
This time we thought
we'd talk a little bit about 3D.

575
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,777
-Get a good look at your opening shot.
-Yeah. Okay, there he goes.

576
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,529
Just come in a little closer.
Just watch your back.

577
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,741
Hi, I'm Angus.

578
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,077
Welcome to the world of 3D.

579
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,830
JACKSON: Shooting The Hobbit in 3D
is a dream come true.

580
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,625
I mean, if l had the ability to shoot
Lord of the Rings in 3D...

581
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,168
...I certainly would have done it.

582
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:53,131
What l actually did on The Lord of the Rings
is I had a 3D camera taking 3D photographs.

583
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,926
Hopefully one day,
maybe even on 3D Blu-ray...

584
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:01,014
...we might be able to actually show you some
of the 3D photos from 1 0 or 12 years ago.

585
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,351
It's 3D and I've got reading glasses.
It's all good.

586
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,146
But now the reality is that
it's not that difficult to shoot in 3D.

587
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:13,276
I love it when a film draws you in
and you become part of the experience.

588
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,321
And 3D helps immerse you in the film.

589
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,367
The essence of our camera system...

590
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:26,039
-...is a camera called the Red Epic.
-It's this that enables us to shoot 3D.

591
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,918
But, of course, to shoot 3D,
you actually need two cameras.

592
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,546
DALEY: The problem
that we have in the cinema world...

593
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,840
...is that the lenses that we use
are so large...

594
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,634
...that we cannot get an interocular
similar to a human's...

595
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,636
...which is the separation between your eyes.

596
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:44,766
For us to get the two cameras as close together
as possible, they have to shoot into a mirror.

597
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,434
JACKSON:
We use a mirror system...

598
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,646
...which is a rig that's designed
by a company called 3ality.

599
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,399
ANGUS:
One's left eye, one's the right eye.

600
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,068
One shoots through a mirror,
the other one bounces off a mirror.

601
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,238
And so the two images are perfectly overlaid.

602
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,700
With using two eyes,
we can move the cameras apart...

603
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,536
...and also, more importantly,
is find a convergence point.

604
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,830
For example, see around someone's face...

605
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,710
-...just like you're looking at a friend.
-The convergence point is the screen plane.

606
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,171
3D forms two places,
positive space, inside the box...

607
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,008
...what you see behind the person
who's standing on the screen...

608
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,219
...and negative space, which is
what you feel comes out into the audience...

609
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,180
...an arm, a bullet or whatever you want.

610
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,310
And the whole idea with these rigs
is you can change the interocular...

611
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,186
...and the convergence as we're shooting.

612
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,105
Come on!

613
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,607
Move, move.

614
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:38,069
We can see that separation on a 2D screen
with a left- and a right-eye overlay.

615
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:43,533
So we can do this live throughout a shot,
changing our 3D effect the whole way through.

616
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,827
WOMAN 1 : And roll sound.
WOMAN 2: Rolling.

617
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,663
We're watching the movie in 3D
as we make it.

618
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,874
Wow, that looks so good.

619
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,793
-You almost feel like you're in it.
WOMAN: Action.

620
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,967
A lot of people have an image of 3D being
big and cumbersome, and that's true...

621
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,971
...but we've got a lot of different rigs
that we've built for different purposes.

622
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,558
It's actually easier in this weird 3D world...

623
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,770
...to have different camera systems
for different uses.

624
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,272
So this is a camera that we built
to go on a crane...

625
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,359
...that can move around,
and that never comes off the crane.

626
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,236
This is the TS5 in a handheld mode.

627
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,865
It's our main workhorse camera.
It's light, it's small...

628
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,828
...so it allows Peter to get into very tight,
narrow corridors and caves...

629
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,872
...as he would with a 2D camera.

630
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,999
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

631
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,336
Mobile camera work has always been
very important for the films that I've made.

632
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,005
And the last thing l wanted to do
when we went into 3D...

633
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,217
...was to restrict or change
the shooting style.

634
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,761
-So with the camera doing that as well...
JACKSON: Yeah.

635
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,763
...you don't need me to do much of it.

636
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,141
JACKSON: lt was important for The Hobbit
that we feel like the same filmmakers...

637
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,811
...have gone back into Middle-earth
to tell a new story.

638
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,814
We're shooting at the same speed
as you'd shoot 2D.

639
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,565
Dollies, cranes, Steadicam.

640
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,277
We put it on the shoulder and shoot handheld,
the same as we would always shoot a movie.

641
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,738
JACKSON: Once you've got three
or four cameras for main unit...

642
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,490
...you need three
or four for second unit...

643
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,951
...which is eight cameras,
which is really 1 6 cameras.

644
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,537
This is the world of The Hobbit
Camera Department.

645
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,874
DALEY: We have 48 Red Epic cameras,
and they're on 17 3D rigs.

646
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,335
This one's called Walter,
which was my grandfather.

647
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,506
This one's Ronald, my uncle.
Emily was Fran's grandmother.

648
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,550
Perkins was actually Fran's dog.

649
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,176
Witchy Poo. Frank.

650
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,636
Bill is my dad.

651
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:30,390
Fergus is the name of one of our pugs.

652
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,309
Tricky Woo,
that's the name of our Pekingese.

653
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,729
Stan is another one of our pugs.

654
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,441
There's cameras called John and Paul,
George and Ringo...

655
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,942
...who are not relations of mine.

656
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,902
Are we having fun?

657
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,237
ALL:
Yay!

658
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,657
We're not shooting film, we shoot digitally.
We shoot onto these cards...

659
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,868
...which slide in the side of the camera.

660
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,953
And each one of these is 128-gig.

661
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,457
On top of that,
you're shooting at 5K resolution.

662
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,168
A very sharp, clear image.

663
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,045
I need, like, a chart.

664
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,548
You know, like, 5K is there,
4K is about there...

665
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:09,220
...and then your 1 080 home TV is down here,
so that gives you sort of an idea...

666
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,223
...of the amount of information
that we're actually capturing on these.

667
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,893
-Let's do another one of those.
WOMAN: Forty-eight frames, yes.

668
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,646
We're shooting The Hobbit at
a higher frame rate, at 48 frames per second...

669
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,775
...which is twice the normal 24 frames.

670
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,652
DALEY:
The human eye sees 60 frames a second.

671
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,073
So 48 frames is more
of a natural progression...

672
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,576
...toward giving the viewer what
they would actually see in the real world.

673
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,622
The people who have seen scenes of
The Hobbit at 48 frames a second often say...

674
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:41,377
...that it's like the back of the cinema has
had a hole cut out of it where the screen is...

675
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,589
...and you're actually looking
into the real world.

676
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:51,179
Once you add stereo and it gives you
that extra ability to control depth...

677
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:55,767
...you can devise ways in which, um,
it can become part of the storytelling of a film.

678
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,770
For instance, in Mirkwood,
we really play on the fact...

679
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,898
...that it's a forest
that's kind of hallucinogenic, almost.

680
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,983
It draws you in.

681
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,319
It makes you part of it,
and you may never get out.

682
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,030
What we want is just "stay where you are,"
and then....

683
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,490
Stay back.

684
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,741
Stay where you are.

685
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:16,287
KELLY: Mirkwood is big and it's full of vines
and sinister-looking trees, l suppose you'd say.

686
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:20,041
It has a lot of things hanging down and
a lot of things coming from all sorts of angles.

687
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:24,379
And it helps us with the 3D to be able
to push into that and try and get the audience...

688
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,507
...to feel that they're trying to move
into the forest with the cameras...

689
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,677
...and give it that dark
and "look over your shoulder' feeling.

690
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,138
HENNAH:
Color-wise with the Red camera...

691
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,891
...it tends to eat color a little,
so we add more color.

692
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,354
If you look at the ungraded footage,
the trees look incredibly psychedelic.

693
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,398
They look like they were painted in 1967.

694
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,234
HENNAH: We wouldn't normally be
quite as bold as this.

695
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:50,822
Even in Mirkwood, which is an enchanted
forest, so it's like we oversaturate.

696
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,448
Look.

697
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,577
In the movie, they won't look anything like that,
they'll be graded down...

698
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,496
...and you'll just get the barest hint of color
in the finished film.

699
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,831
They're coming back.

700
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,416
Move!

701
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,544
3D, 48 frames is pretty unforgiving...

702
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,797
...and we have to change our whole way
to go about coloring these things.

703
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:13,011
Because we found out in early tests that
if there wasn't enough red in these pieces...

704
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,597
...they would punch up yellow
and react differently...

705
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,849
...than normal skin
with blood running through it.

706
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,977
So here's an example.
This is Graham McTavish as Dwalin...

707
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,940
...and, um, we've had to add a lot of red tones
to his makeup.

708
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,152
So if you notice, if you stick your hand up
next to your face...

709
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,197
...how incredibly pale this man is right now.

710
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,450
I've barely seen daylight
for the last six months, that's why.

711
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,454
So we have to add the blood in the piece
to make him look like a normal flesh tone.

712
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,958
It looks freaky now,
but on film it's gonna read beautifully.

713
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,210
Fingers crossed.

714
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,878
KING:
With the 3D, HD stuff...

715
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:52,759
...it is amazing how, when people's hair moves
around on the wigs, it has to be the real thing.

716
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,260
It has to be real hair.

717
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,264
And you find, because of the number of frames
per second you're using and so forth...

718
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,601
...if you've got real hair moving around,
it just looks real.

719
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:06,773
I've never worked on a film that's 48 frames per
second and uses the cameras that we're using.

720
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,817
It's challenging to look for fabrics that work.

721
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,947
I know full well that a fabric that we bought
ages ago for a dressing gown for Bilbo...

722
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,283
...would probably make people feel sick
if they saw it on camera.

723
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,328
It's got spots on it, with a little spot inside it.

724
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:23,498
And it would just be like someone throwing
stones at your face, I think.

725
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,668
So I've avoided that fabric like the plague.

726
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,754
It's in very poor taste.

727
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,884
Others are just a joy to behold
and the camera picks it up...

728
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,138
...and the audience can see every last detail,
so in that sense it's really exciting.

729
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,101
This film is really breaking new grounds
in many ways...

730
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,187
...as far as the technology
of the filming goes...

731
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:51,276
...but John and I are still working in our
time-honored methods of pencil and charcoal...

732
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,777
...composing pictures in 2D.

733
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,698
We thought we'd try and come up with some
way of actually incorporating a 3D aspect...

734
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,117
...into the way that
we were producing the concept art...

735
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:03,162
...that might communicate more clearly to Peter
and to the other technicians.

736
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,500
So what we're doing is two drawings,
one is in red, one is in blue...

737
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,379
...and the 3D glasses have a red lens
and a blue lens, one for each eye.

738
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,464
Don't go too heavy on that.

739
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:18,428
It's probably the first serious cinema
production where the actual concept art...

740
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,221
...has been done in 3D.

741
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,057
Rather than sharing just the same office,
we're actually sharing...

742
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,435
-...basically the same vision. Yes.
-Vision, yeah.

743
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,730
HOWE: There's been a bit of a tendency for me
to take on the blue.

744
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,025
And obviously, you know,
sitting on the right-hand side of the picture...

745
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,736
...it's easier to actually get your head
around the left side.

746
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,614
It doesn't make sense when you try
and explain it like that.

747
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:44,620
It's a huge help for Peter because
we're actually proposing the full depth.

748
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,124
It means Peter has to wear glasses
when he looks at our art, but....

749
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,210
My God, coming at you. Look at that, whoa.

750
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,715
If you happen to have a pair of glasses
like these at home...

751
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:59,802
...you should be able to see
the artwork in 3D.

752
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,223
You look great. Very three-dimensional.

753
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,602
-You've definitely improved.
-I know.

754
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,981
I hope you've found this blog interesting.
I know it's a little frustrating...

755
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,525
...because just about everything
we've been talking about...

756
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,319
...you can't actually see at the moment.

757
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,782
You can't see the 3D, you can't see
the 48 frames, you can't see the 5K...

758
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,075
...but you will.

759
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:27,372
December, 201 2, you'll get a chance
to see what we've been talking about.

760
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,040
Anyway, I've gotta get back to set.

761
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,292
It looks like they're almost ready
for me down there.

762
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,253
We're actually shooting today,
as you can see, in a pine forest.

763
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,214
But it's not really a pine forest.

764
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,926
It's a polystyrene and plaster pine forest.

765
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,762
But very shortly,
we're gonna be leaving the studio...

766
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,181
...and moving onto locations
for a few months.

767
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,143
So the next time we see you will be
from a location somewhere in New Zealand.

768
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,728
Catch up with you soon.

769
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,926
Dwarves in boats, eh?
Everybody thinks they're a sailor.

770
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,137
So welcome to our new blog...

771
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,140
...which is about the logistics
of location shooting.

772
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,351
We've been traveling pretty much the length
and breadth of New Zealand...

773
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,271
...shooting locations for The Hobbit.
It's been great to get outside.

774
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,691
It's been great to get that texture
of Middle-earth into the movie...

775
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,527
...after many, many weeks
of shooting in the studio.

776
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,697
We've established our characters,
we've established our story.

777
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:43,865
Charge!

778
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,660
And it was finally time to get on the road
and establish the landscapes of Middle-earth.

779
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:55,543
YORKE: So we're currently moving about
500 crew for Main Unit to Hamilton.

780
00:45:55,711 --> 00:46:00,590
And then about 200 to Second Unit crew
to various parts of the country.

781
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,968
We call it the biggest logistical move
in cinematic history.

782
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,763
Just because of the size of the fleet.
Close to 140 vehicles.

783
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,934
As you can see,
we're moving around a huge circus.

784
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:17,940
I think everyone is secretly scared,
but quietly excited.

785
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,401
The main reason for going on location...

786
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,863
...is to capture the scenic beauty
of New Zealand.

787
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,241
Peter's often said...

788
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,870
...one of the things that won the fans over
so much in The Lord of the Rings series...

789
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:36,792
...was the unbelievable vistas and scenics,
because they were so magnificent.

790
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,380
People are really excited about getting outside
and taking this on the road.

791
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:47,803
These are our changes from Main Unit crew.
This is how big we actually are.

792
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,430
We're probably over 500.

793
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,308
JACKSON: Everybody has to be
in the right vehicle at the right time.

794
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,311
They have to travel to the right place,
have to have rooms to sleep in.

795
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:59,857
I can't begin to imagine the logistics involved
with shifting the crew...

796
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,860
...the cast, the equipment we have
on The Hobbit. lt's mind-blowing.

797
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,696
You have to take everything with you
to produce the films.

798
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,741
JACKSON: We're having to provide
our own electricity, areas to cook food.

799
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,119
Areas for people to sit down and eat.
You've gotta provide water.

800
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,581
The bathrooms and the toilets people need.
You have to have weather cover.

801
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,418
Heat when it's cold
and you've gotta provide cooling when it's hot.

802
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,380
The daunting aspect of that
is that it's got to get into trucks.

803
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,549
It's gotta be on wheels and be ready to roll.

804
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,511
We're about to try and cram all of this...

805
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,474
...and all of that, all of this, some of that...

806
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,228
...most of this,
all these trucks, most of these people....

807
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,480
But not that scissor lift up there,
that stays.

808
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,816
They're gonna go
into some of these trucks.

809
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,485
These guys here
are gonna go into these trucks too.

810
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,820
Nice work.

811
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,823
No cell phone laws here, man.

812
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,492
One of our biggest challenges
on the production...

813
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,786
...is actually shooting all the locations
in one hit.

814
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,789
For both Main Unit and Second Unit.

815
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,583
You can certainly start there.

816
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,254
YORKE: We're away for about
seven and a half weeks.

817
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,672
If the weather holds up.

818
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,090
So we're basically praying...

819
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:10,428
...that every spot we go to in the country
is sunny and beautiful.

820
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,764
The first location is Matamata,
up in old Hobbiton.

821
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,351
Returning back to the first spot
from Lord of the Rings.

822
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,438
Fantastic job and we're out of here
at 4:00 in the morning.

823
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,858
-As you can see, we're totally under control.
-Yeah. Ha, ha.

824
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,991
WOMAN: Why aren't you helping?
-I've gotta carry this.

825
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,201
We're going to the remotest locations
of New Zealand.

826
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,414
And if there's one thing grips can't
live without, it's their latte. Soy.

827
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,124
That's right.

828
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,004
We're getting ready to go away.
We haven't packed anything.

829
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,464
And tomorrow's our last day.

830
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,593
We have 30-odd Hobbits doing a big scene
against green screen for Hobbiton.

831
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,012
This is my Louie Hobbit
and my Sonny Hobbit.

832
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:59,143
So we need the largest team on
because we've also got to try and pack.

833
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,063
They're gonna say,
"Did you pack it? I need it.

834
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,398
Where's that wig?
We've got to put it on his head now."

835
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,735
And we'll all be here till midnight
trying to load up the buses...

836
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,695
...because they leave at 4:00 in the morning.

837
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,115
Be sure to pack Scotch, tequila....

838
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,159
-Wine and beer.
-And a heap of plants.

839
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,952
-Three razor blades.
-Sixty kilos of--

840
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,871
-Toilet paper.
-A few artificial trees.

841
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,456
-Socks.
-And some Jägermeister.

842
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,000
Last day in Wellington,
so everything needs to move.

843
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:30,716
We've got a stock truck coming in to take
our 49 mixed-age sheep, 1 5 chickens...

844
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:35,721
...nine goats, five 3-year-old steers,
four pheasants, two Muscovy ducks.

845
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,016
And we've also got Michael Jackson,
the walking chicken, on the lead.

846
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,731
HARRIS: We're just gonna take you through,
get your contracts done.

847
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,943
We've got lunch packed for you
to take on the road.

848
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,986
So just follow me.

849
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,531
-Oh, the keys are in it?
HARRIS: The keys are in it.

850
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,825
We've got GPS units installed in the trucks...

851
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:59,662
...so we can watch what's happening
as they move up the country.

852
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,331
If you don't arrive, we can't shoot.

853
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,251
The last truck should be out of here
in half an hour.

854
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,253
And then Hobbiton. Crikey.

855
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,885
Just remember the reason you're on this plane
is because you're so valuable to the production.

856
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,479
CONNON: Our Main Unit
had over a hundred units on wheels...

857
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,523
...that were traveling to the first location.

858
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,901
That was quite a feat in itself, just having
that amount of drivers on the road.

859
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,988
It's all about arrows.
It's all about maps and directions.

860
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,200
We get in, and it's about
an eight-hour turnaround...

861
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:42,705
...from when the first truck turns up
to when the unit base is functional for filming.

862
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,874
They've gotta get these trucks level
for working in.

863
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:48,711
Gotta get them all powered up and they've
gotta get them all functioning so quickly.

864
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,131
Prosthetics, Makeup, Costume, Catering.

865
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,302
It's not just a case of a small crew
going into very out-of-the-way places.

866
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,013
We're literally occupying the space
of a football field.

867
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,848
I think it's actually two football fields.

868
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,559
GORDON:
We've moved 7000 cubic meters of dirt...

869
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,688
...to accommodate everything
that goes with making a film of this size.

870
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,649
It's very much a mini city.

871
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:14,403
SPECHT: To everyone's amazement, you know,
they went home on Friday night in Wellington...

872
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:19,408
...turn up to work here on Monday morning,
and everything's here and working.

873
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:30,920
-It's okay.
MAN: Ha, ha.

874
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,214
Rough day at the once today, Mom.

875
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,970
So after 1 1 0 days in the studio,
we finally make it out into the sunshine.

876
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,306
But l'll tell you what,
Hobbiton is looking fantastic.

877
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:46,435
The Art Department and the Greens Department
have been working on it for nearly two years.

878
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,979
The grasses have grown,
the flowers are out.

879
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,065
And the plastic ones have even bloomed.

880
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,734
It's weird when you come back to a place...

881
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,487
...that you literally thought
you would never see again.

882
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,697
This is a great spot.

883
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,117
Standing there with Elijah
dressed up as Frodo, ha, ha....

884
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,163
It was the nearest thing l'm ever going to come
to a time machine.

885
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,291
This is actually the first time
I'm stepping foot down into Hobbiton.

886
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,632
I'll never forget that feeling
of coming to Hobbiton for the first time.

887
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:21,387
So much time spent in this universe,
you know, with these characters.

888
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:27,893
And I keep referencing the fact that I turned 1 9
when l came to Hobbiton for the first time. Heh.

889
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,980
Eleven years ago. l'm 30 now.

890
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:38,279
I don't know, there's so many feelings
of nostalgia and history.

891
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,156
HENNAH: We'd been searching pretty much
the whole country...

892
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,909
...for this rolling green countryside.

893
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:47,830
We were scouting around
and found this place called Buckland Road.

894
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,249
And sure enough, when we flew over it...

895
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:54,670
...we found the round tree, the hill, the lake.

896
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,505
It was all meant to be.

897
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,092
Of course, then it was a matter
of talking to the owners of the land.

898
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,095
Getting their permission to shoot here
and build here.

899
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,515
It was a Sunday afternoon
during a rugby game...

900
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,517
...that he came and knocked
on my father's door.

901
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,229
And he said that they wanted to make a movie.
My father actually said, "Lord of the what?"

902
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:16,066
And I think l kicked him under the table quietly.
But, uh, that's how it all started.

903
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,653
So this time around, they built it for real.

904
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:25,409
So before, all of these Hobbit holes
were built using polystyrene.

905
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,245
When the filming was finished,
they tore it all down.

906
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,916
Even though it's been available for tours
and, you know, for people to look at...

907
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,918
...we didn't have any
of the Hobbit holes here.

908
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:38,923
Doing The Hobbit now, it gave us the ability
to rebuild Hobbiton out of permanent materials.

909
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,674
Materials that aren't gonna deteriorate.

910
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:45,220
And we can carry on showing people what's
involved in making a movie, behind the scenes.

911
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:51,977
It's all.... I mean that's actual rock, stone.

912
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,063
It's pretty amazing.

913
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,608
JACKSON: Hobbiton's gonna stay exactly
as it is today.

914
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,444
There's real wood, there's real stone,
real bricks...

915
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,988
...and it's going to be here, hopefully,
for decades to come.

916
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,950
Yeah. lt's a great gift
to the people of Matamata.

917
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,787
And as minister of tourism,
I'm all in favor of it, so well done.

918
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,123
Some prime real estate.

919
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,960
Hobbits.

920
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,878
-Hello.
MAN: Hello.

921
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,713
-Hello.
-Are you guys having a good day?

922
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,256
Yes, good.

923
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,925
-Hey.
-How are those feet treating you?

924
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,843
-Yeah, heh, they're okay.
-Are they?

925
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,597
JACKSON: When you're at Hobbiton,
you forget that you're on a film set.

926
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:32,643
Seeing it like this living model village
is just extraordinary.

927
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,855
And you just totally believe this place exists.
And that's because it does.

928
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,232
MAN:
Cut.

929
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,568
Maybe I've smoked a little bit too much
of this, um, now.

930
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,861
It's an authentic village.

931
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:49,868
It's a hundred percent, 360-degree,
look wherever you like, little Hobbit village.

932
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,664
You can imagine just being a Hobbit
in this environment.

933
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:59,336
Get up and have a cup of tea on the doorstep
and listen to the birds and the frogs.

934
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:03,007
And the children running around.
Or go to the market, buy a big bottle of beer.

935
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,300
-And drink it.
-And loving it.

936
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,302
JACKSON:
You're not really designing a film set.

937
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,722
You're trying to put yourself
in the mindset of a Hobbit.

938
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,391
And figuring out, well,
where would you like your house to be?

939
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,352
VINCENT:
There are 44 personalized Hobbit holes...

940
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,148
...and each has different details,
depending on their location.

941
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,192
That's kind of amazing.
The doors actually open.

942
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,403
Hello? Hello? No.

943
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,989
Nobody home at the moment.
They must be at the market.

944
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,076
Welcome to the set of The Hobbit.

945
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,749
MAN:
So how did you get involved in this?

946
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:41,211
My four daughters auditioned,
and they all missed out and l got in.

947
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:45,090
So I wasn't a popular father at that point.
Ha, ha.

948
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,552
-You guys are up for stealing, aren't you?
-Yeah.

949
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,054
We're big, bad Hobbits.

950
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,934
MAN:
Check this out. Oh, yeah.

951
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,270
I like to get a nice comb-over.

952
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,772
Is this going to be in the movie?

953
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,899
JACKSON:
Cut, that's fantastic. We've got that.

954
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,694
So we just finished our first week
on location.

955
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:10,240
But, you know, I just wish l could move
into one of these Hobbit holes.

956
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,368
I mean, this would be an absolutely
idyllic place to live. lt really would.

957
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:18,499
This is the sort of place
that I would very happily retire to.

958
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,794
In fact, uh, l might think about it tonight
or the next day.

959
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,881
It'd be good, retiring here.
That would be quite nice.

960
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,886
-Thank you. Bye-bye.
MAN: The end.

961
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,848
I hope you enjoyed the first part
of our location blog.

962
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,811
The second part will be really
very early in the new year.

963
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:44,024
And, in the meantime, we've just shot
the last shot for The Hobbit in 201 1 .

964
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:48,362
So it only remains to do one last thing,
which is to wish you all a Merry Christmas.

965
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,031
ALL:
Merry Christmas!

966
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,744
JACKSON:
Champagne.

967
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,456
Very good.

968
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,550
Welcome to the first blog of 201 2.

969
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,844
MAN:
Push!

970
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,513
JACKSON:
We're shooting part two of The Hobbit today.

971
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,765
I'm here in Lake-town,
but l can't show you anything.

972
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,560
I can't show you the amazing set
that's over there...

973
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:24,064
...and the incredible thing that's over there
because you're not allowed to see that till 201 3.

974
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,902
But what we can show you are the continuation
of our location adventures.

975
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,906
So if you remember from our last
exciting episode, we were in Hobbiton...

976
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,869
...so let's pick it up from where we left off
and travel around the rest of New Zealand.

977
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,164
So we've just finished
our first week on location.

978
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,960
So it's goodbye to Hobbiton
and, uh, hello to our next spot.

979
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,431
Here is the weather in Piopio today.

980
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,475
It has, of course, been raining.

981
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:06,315
Welcome to Denize Bluffs. We brought
the weather with us, which is great.

982
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,152
We don't have umbrellas in the movie.

983
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,653
No, see, the colors clash.

984
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,574
What's weird is
you're on the sets in the studio...

985
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,492
...and they look so real.

986
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,621
You come out on location,
this almost looks fake.

987
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:24,374
Because you think, "This can't exist."
It's just weird.

988
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,835
-Not real, it's a trick.
-It's a trick.

989
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,879
-Mind games.
-It's done with mirrors.

990
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,303
It's a very nice environment.
Some nice stuff up in there.

991
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,598
Just gonna be a bit lumpy getting stuff around
and building stuff on rocks...

992
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,560
...and bits and pieces, but it'll be nice.
Good location.

993
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:48,857
I'm just worried about the dinosaurs.

994
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:03,246
So here we are at the Turoa ski field
on the flanks of Mount Ruapehu.

995
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,958
This is the second oldest
national park in the world.

996
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:10,545
Very ancient vegetation. Magnificent colors,
magnificent textures, but very fragile.

997
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,381
And we've gone to exceptional lengths...

998
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,175
...to actually make sure
the impact on the site is minimized.

999
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,803
So it's about scaffolding,
it's about elevated boardwalks...

1000
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,138
...to keep people off the vegetation.

1001
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:24,059
We built the world's biggest ramp
to get down to the thing.

1002
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:28,021
Everybody walked out to the edge this morning
and looked at it, and jaws dropped, and went:

1003
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,858
"Wow, okay. Heh.
So that's how we get onto set today."

1004
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,112
This is my favorite location. lt's beautiful.

1005
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,656
There's a mountain, there's a waterfall.

1006
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,076
There's a beautiful view
across a valley there.

1007
00:59:41,285 --> 00:59:43,912
It's one of those sort of archetypal Kiwi places
that you think:

1008
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,249
"God, New Zealand
has such amazing landscapes."

1009
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,628
Jesus, it's a bit sad
when the grips are going faster than l am...

1010
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,089
...and they're carrying heavy metal.

1011
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,590
Yeah.

1012
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,594
Andy Serkis jumped in the icy cold stream...

1013
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:03,390
...to chase the fish as Gollum
about, uh, 1 2 years ago.

1014
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,225
Just over there.

1015
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:15,694
So welcome to the first day on location
with Second Unit.

1016
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:19,948
I've spent quite a lot of the last few weeks
in a chopper...

1017
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,576
...because a lot of our stuff
was aerial coverage.

1018
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,996
We'd take off and choose our line
and choose the way we were gonna shoot it...

1019
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,124
...and how we were gonna reveal
the landscapes.

1020
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,754
We're using the space cam
on all the aerial stuff.

1021
01:00:34,338 --> 01:00:36,423
This particular rig is set up for 3D.

1022
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,677
There's a chopper behind me, isn't there?

1023
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,142
The bonuses of being on Second Unit
is that we do a lot of locations...

1024
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,687
...that are too tricky or time consuming
for Main Unit to go to...

1025
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,440
...so a lot of our locations were
helicopter-only access.

1026
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:56,777
So we got very, very good
at loading in and out of choppers.

1027
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:05,619
JACKSON: So you've got literally two units
that are now crisscrossing the country...

1028
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,454
...both the North and South Islands.

1029
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:11,041
About halfway through our location shoot,
First and Second Units met up...

1030
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:16,338
...and it happened to be exactly halfway
through the entire shoot, day 127.

1031
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:20,175
And we commemorated that with a hoodie,
a halfway hoodie.

1032
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:24,679
But it's 1 27 days, and, uh, it's two films.

1033
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:29,309
Now, l've got a 1 33-day
Lord of the Rings jumper...

1034
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,561
-...which was for three films.
JACKSON: Yes.

1035
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:35,148
So 1 33 days for three films
and 1 27 days for two films.

1036
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,109
-Yes, easily explained.
-How?

1037
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,652
Well, we're all 1 0 years older...

1038
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,779
-...so we're going a little slower.
-That's true.

1039
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:44,908
One of the challenges was showing P.J.
what we'd been up to.

1040
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,411
So every day I would then do a kind of an edit
of the takes that we'd done...

1041
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,790
...put them together and make some selects,
then that would be sent off to Pete.

1042
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:56,211
We are a long way from most
of the infrastructure that we know and love.

1043
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,883
So we've had to rely on satellite technology
to do all of our connectivity.

1044
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:06,179
These are the dishes we're setting up
to provide lnternet for the crew.

1045
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,224
We're providing wireless and lnternet.
We've also got a separate setup...

1046
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:12,686
...that's up at the director's tent
that's beaming in footage from Second Unit...

1047
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,480
...that takes the feed that's coming in
from the cameras...

1048
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,900
...compresses it, sends it over the Internet
all the way down to Peter's tent.

1049
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:23,113
So far we've probably used
about six kilometers of cable on the job.

1050
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:26,324
I'm not sure where it's all gone,
but we, uh, keep on ordering more of it.

1051
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,791
Strath Taieri, Central Otago...

1052
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:40,130
...this is a location where you can literally
shoot 360 degrees every direction.

1053
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,798
Had some incredible skies.

1054
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,509
What we'd call
"Close encounters of the Third Kind skies."

1055
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,804
And where our skies are a little boring,
because we've shot over three days...

1056
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,056
...we'll probably replace them
with these cool skies.

1057
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,559
I'd love to do that.
Get some real mood into it.

1058
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:57,105
One of the days of shooting on this location
was actually up on the hill...

1059
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,107
...something called
the Rock and Pillar Range.

1060
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:02,235
If you just look over there...

1061
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,280
...it's pretty much that distant ridgeline
between those two rocks.

1062
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:07,282
That's what they call the Rock and Pillars...

1063
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:13,955
...where we had to have 1 0 helicopters ferrying
crew, cast, and equipment up the mountain.

1064
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,375
This is Adam Brown's first helicopter ride.

1065
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,294
-Oh, my God.
-Are you so excited?

1066
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:21,755
-I'm well excited.
-You should be.

1067
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:31,223
-And in. Oh, he's in, he's in.
-Aah! Christ, it's on video.

1068
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,350
MAN:
And action.

1069
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,855
Whoo-hoo. Amazing.

1070
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:43,318
JACKSON: So we're packing up at the end
of our location shooting here at Strath Taieri...

1071
01:03:43,527 --> 01:03:45,237
...and going to Queenstown.

1072
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,993
Here we are, beautiful Queenstown.

1073
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,288
We're, uh, just at the base
outside the Earnslaw Burn...

1074
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:59,960
...which is the most spectacular
shooting location l think we've been to yet.

1075
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,715
We're shortly gonna do a rendition of
"The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Music."

1076
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,844
Starting with Mark Abbot, he's over there.
He's getting into his Maria position, there he is.

1077
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:18,311
It's snow.

1078
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,522
Bare feet was a bad choice.

1079
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:32,033
We've been to Paradise before.

1080
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,245
That's where we shot a few scenes
of The Fellowship of the Rings mainly...

1081
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,997
...back in 1 999.

1082
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,666
Lothlorien Forest. Boromir's death.

1083
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,668
MAN:
Cut!

1084
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,169
The great thing about this job...

1085
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:46,131
...you get to see beautiful,
beautiful places like this.

1086
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:50,802
So you don't have to feel sorry for actors
leaving home for seven and a half weeks.

1087
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,929
We're very, very well looked after.

1088
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,807
The catering on this movie
has been sensational.

1089
01:04:56,517 --> 01:05:00,770
The numbers we were doing on location
were between 300 and 400...

1090
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:04,858
...until we got to Twizel,
then we were doing 570, 580...

1091
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,777
...because we had quite a few extras
there as well.

1092
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:11,489
We cook 1 00, at least, kilos
of meat every day.

1093
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:16,369
One of the guys worked out that
we've been through a ton of oranges already.

1094
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:21,041
It's formal Friday today,
so we're dressed in suits.

1095
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,754
It's one of the only ways for the crew
to know what day of the week it is.

1096
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,049
Every morning we crank out
about 200, 300 coffees.

1097
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,969
We're heading off to the hills
to look after a crew of about 1 00 people...

1098
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,221
...who have all been choppered up
into the mountains.

1099
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,308
It being in the mountains,
there's snow around, so it's cold...

1100
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,394
...so obviously, in formal dress
sometimes it's not practical...

1101
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:45,899
...so as you can see here, Andrew has gone
from a three-piece to a four-piece...

1102
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,235
...with the addition
of a nice, cozy puffer jacket.

1103
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,156
Because you can't always look good,
sometimes you have to be sensible.

1104
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:02,957
Sometimes you take for granted...

1105
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:07,212
...the scenery in the country where you live,
so to come out on the road is really amazing.

1106
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,380
Good morning.

1107
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,216
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1108
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,884
I can't believe how nice it is.

1109
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:17,555
-We're the luckiest short people in the world.
-The luckiest people in the world.

1110
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,974
I think it comes into people,
not even height restricting.

1111
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,647
New Zealand
looking at its spectacular best...

1112
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:31,236
...and, uh, a lot of very happy actors
cavorting around in front of it.

1113
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,458
JACKSON: Braemar Station was pretty difficult
working conditions for the cast and the crew...

1114
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,294
...because the tussock
and the ground's very uneven.

1115
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,841
This is matagouri,
a New Zealand native kind of thorn bush...

1116
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,261
...which is everywhere
that you ever wanna walk.

1117
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,888
McKELLEN: You can't just parade
through the tussocks...

1118
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,724
...and the rocks and pebbles
without looking.

1119
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:05,520
You suddenly realize that being out of doors
in Middle-earth can be a difficult business...

1120
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:08,106
...particularly when there's a pack of Orcs
or Wargs.

1121
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,900
-Dances with Wargs.
-Heavenly Wargs.

1122
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,444
"The Boy Who Cried Warg."

1123
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,155
-Aliens versus Wargs.
-I was a Teenage Warg.

1124
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:17,323
McTAVlSH:
Enormous amount of running.

1125
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,202
Scene 88, I think,
is actually going to be a third film.

1126
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,914
It'll be coming out
between the first and the second.

1127
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,042
JACKSON: lt's actually, for the most part,
easier working inside a studio...

1128
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,879
...but, of course, the studio doesn't have
the incredible vistas...

1129
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,589
...and that's what we were there for.

1130
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:38,011
Eight kilometers from Mount Cook,
surrounded by the guys behind me.

1131
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,014
Unbelievable.

1132
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,687
This is the Pelorus Bridge
over the Pelorus River...

1133
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,272
...where we are shooting today.

1134
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:58,948
I think my favorite day on set, unquestionably,
was floating down the Pelorus River in barrels.

1135
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,827
Finally gonna, um, put our Dwarves
in the barrels.

1136
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,206
That actually looks like fun, I'd do it myself...

1137
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,124
...if l wasn't busy doing other things.

1138
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,834
MAN:
Oh, my God.

1139
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:16,758
Today we're, uh, swinging over the river.
We got some Dwarves coming down in barrels.

1140
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,135
JACKSON:
Keep going, everybody. That's good.

1141
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,054
Yeah.

1142
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,349
HUNTER:
That was way cool.

1143
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:28,728
And if they ever make that a ride
at any of these Warner Bros. movie worlds...

1144
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:29,979
...lifetime pass, please.

1145
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,440
JACKSON:
While we were at Pelorus...

1146
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,443
...our location shooting
came to a pretty dramatic end...

1147
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:39,656
...because the police arrived and said they
were about to issue a severe-weather warning.

1148
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:42,825
MAN 1 : Okay, we need to shoot please.
It's raining. We need to get going.

1149
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,410
MAN 2:
B marker.

1150
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,372
JACKSON: And l've never seen a crew
pack up their gear so quickly.

1151
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:53,461
The very next day,
everywhere where we were standing...

1152
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,422
...where our equipment was,
our cameras, our actors, the director...

1153
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:00,051
...was under flood water.
It was incredibly dramatic.

1154
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:04,347
The rise in the river level was like 20, 30 feet.

1155
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,475
-And that's location.
MAN 1 : Yes.

1156
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,935
MAN 2:
Done.

1157
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,982
JACKSON:
So that's the end of our location shooting...

1158
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:17,819
...and we are about
to go into our last 1 00 days...

1159
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,904
...what we're calling block three.

1160
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,700
And, uh, look forward to talking to you again
very, very soon.

1161
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,423
Hi. So welcome to our new blog.

1162
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,675
We have taken you away
with us on location.

1163
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,887
But we thought that today you might enjoy
having a little look into our studio.

1164
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,556
Stone Street.

1165
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,392
The public obviously aren't allowed
in here while we're shooting.

1166
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,685
Morning.

1167
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,022
But we thought it would be great
to give you all a private little tour...

1168
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:58,526
...around the world of The hobbit
here at Stone Street in Miramar, New Zealand.

1169
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,570
Used to be an old paint factory.

1170
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,489
We got hold of it just before
we started The Lord of The Rings.

1171
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,576
We built one sound studio
for Lord of the Rings.

1172
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,536
We built another one on King Kong.

1173
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,080
And we built a couple more
here for The Hobbit.

1174
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:14,792
And it's actually a great place
to make movies right now.

1175
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:20,465
Hi. This is Block 4, the Production Office.
Come on in.

1176
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,051
This is the office.
And our boss, Brigitte Yorke.

1177
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:27,722
-We must get a plane for Howard Shore.
CONNOLLY: I'm working hard on this folder.

1178
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,182
Have you got some filing skills?

1179
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,602
-It's top secret. You can't see.
-I'm learning how to open it and close it.

1180
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:38,316
TAKACS: Emma processing contracts
in the mother freighter of Three Foot Seven.

1181
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,944
Kate Mulligan will find you
whatever crazy thing you need.

1182
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:45,114
And this is Rach. She coordinates
and distributes all our script revisions.

1183
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:49,869
I've just got some urgent script revisions
to go out to all cast immediately.

1184
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:53,498
I'm gonna hand these ones over to Mike.
He'll take them over to Jimmy Nesbitt for us.

1185
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,591
MIKE: Jimmy, some pages.
-Yeah.

1186
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,386
Don't look at me directly in the eyes.
Oh, hello.

1187
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:11,474
Thorin. Bard. Gandalf.

1188
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,142
Nothing for me. Come in.

1189
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,979
You can see the world that we inhabit here
for the last 25 years.

1190
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:20,358
Decorated the trailer with things
that remind me of home.

1191
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,444
Villages and the seaside in Northern lreland,
where l'm from.

1192
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,029
My horse, Riverside Theatre.

1193
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:29,867
That's Martin and l.
He plays, um...one of the characters in it.

1194
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:33,246
And, uh, there's the main character,
me, Bofur.

1195
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,081
Hello, everybody.

1196
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:38,251
Um, my name is Luke Evans and l play Bard.

1197
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,920
And I'm gonna take you on a little trip
around Trailer Park.

1198
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:45,174
We have 21 trailers where we've been living
for the last seven and a half years.

1199
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,301
-This is Aidan, Kili.
-Look at this.

1200
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,387
-My neighbor.
-Who are these guys?

1201
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,848
I don't know.
I'm just trying to show them around.

1202
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:53,182
-Stephen.
HUNTER: How are you?

1203
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,268
It's a long time we spend here sometimes...

1204
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:59,230
...when they're setting up scenes.
It takes a long time, so....

1205
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,149
It's like flatting, isn't it?

1206
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:02,942
-Basically. What's "flatting"?
-Yeah.

1207
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,444
Dean-o!

1208
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:07,905
They keep all the young, good-looking lads
at one end.

1209
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,866
The ugly buggers
don't want to mix with us.

1210
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:13,411
That was rubbish! Where's the green frog?

1211
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:17,415
Good morning.

1212
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:22,628
And welcome to Stone Street.
I'm just off to my prosthetics.

1213
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,006
-Morning all.
WOMAN: Good morning.

1214
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,926
Okay, so this is my spot currently,
with the lovely Rachelle.

1215
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,803
And now we're about to start the process.

1216
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:35,558
Come and see me again in a couple of hours,
when l'll look radically different.

1217
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,936
Two hours later, here we are.

1218
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:42,523
-Hey, Peter, we are traveling in five.
HAMBLETON: Okay.

1219
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:48,112
Hey, guys, come with me. I'll take you
to the ADs' Portacom, home for a lot of us.

1220
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:52,784
Down in the, uh, ADs' Portacom,
we've got 1 1 ADs who work on Main Unit.

1221
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:55,536
We come up with a bit of a plan,
and then we run it from here.

1222
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,497
-Action.
-So on with the show.

1223
01:12:57,664 --> 01:13:00,583
Locations Department decided
to put some beautiful pictures up...

1224
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,169
...of sunny New Zealand.
Here in Wellington we get sunny days.

1225
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,505
But they are few and far between.
We get a lot of rain.

1226
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:07,006
I've got a wet ass.

1227
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:11,135
DARLING: But we also get hail. Lots of hail.
-Aah!

1228
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,096
Come on in to Block 3.
There's some busy little bees down there.

1229
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:29,111
Hey, guys. How you doing? Welcome to
The Hobbit Stunt Department. l just died.

1230
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,864
Okay, so this is the intensity
we like to bring on set every day.

1231
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,116
Hopefully, you enjoy it.
Come on, guys, let's go!

1232
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,828
Going on set, come on. Let's go!

1233
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:50,716
Welcome to the Hair and Makeup Department.
Here we are on Day 5953 of shooting.

1234
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:54,470
And we're now actually trying
to repair the wigs...

1235
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:57,431
...that have been doing the barrel sequence
for the past three days.

1236
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:00,852
As you can see, this wig's a lovely,
lovely natural blond color.

1237
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:04,689
Whereas the other wigs that we've now
got here, which have been bleached.

1238
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:08,943
And so now l have to try and turn these wigs
back into this wig.

1239
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,530
So that's my job for the rest of the day,
to get all the wigs ready for Monday.

1240
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,120
MASKREY:
We're in the Costume Workshop.

1241
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,248
We've got racks here for all our Dwarves.

1242
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:26,419
Because we have to do constant repeats
for their stunt doubles, their photo doubles.

1243
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,046
Then we've got our flesh factory...

1244
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:33,843
...where three people have been making
the Dwarf fat-suit components.

1245
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,179
Oh, yeah.

1246
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,556
So this is A Stage.

1247
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,726
This is the stage that we built, um,
in time for Lord ofthe Rings.

1248
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:46,022
It was our biggest stage then, so we did things
like Elrond's chamber at Rivendell...

1249
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:48,232
...where the Council of Elrond took place.

1250
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,402
B Stage has, amazingly enough,
been used for a lot of shooting.

1251
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:55,031
There was a lot of Lord ofthe Rings.
Bag-end was built here in B Stage.

1252
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:58,743
You can hardly call it a studio, really.
It's just an old tin shed.

1253
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:04,624
Kind of feels a bit like I'm driving the tram
at Universal Studios, ha, ha, l guess.

1254
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:08,419
Over here we do have our biggest sound stage,
which is called K Stage.

1255
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,796
K being named after King Kong.

1256
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:13,215
We've had some pretty big set pieces
in here recently.

1257
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:17,553
Mirkwood Forest
and some of the Trollshaw Forest scenes.

1258
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:20,640
Here we have F and G.
These are our two newest stages.

1259
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,683
Been built specifically for The Hobbit.

1260
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,102
They've pretty much got
the latest technology inside them.

1261
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:30,024
And rather large extraction units
for all those fires and flames and smoke.

1262
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,819
JACKSON: At the very end of the studios
is the Art Department.

1263
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:37,740
The home of Dan Hennah,
Alan Lee and John Howe.

1264
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,742
Good morning.
Welcome to the Art Department.

1265
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,996
Come on in. l think the production designer
is in. G'day, Dan.

1266
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:46,040
-Hello, dear boy. All good?
TlPPLER: Fantastic.

1267
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,835
HENNAH: We've got six weeks and two days
of principal photography left.

1268
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:52,755
We're shooting the sluices at the moment,
which is filmed on sets.

1269
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:57,760
-We're very busy.
-Over here is our set decorator, Ra Vincent.

1270
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:02,139
Hi. Come with me.
I've got something very cool to show you.

1271
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:03,724
This is my favorite place.

1272
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:10,022
It brings into play all of the ideas from all the
individual contributors in the Art Department.

1273
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,358
And they get to share
all their ideas in here.

1274
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:15,027
And this is where the first spark
of inspiration begins.

1275
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:18,406
And in this office is Alan Lee
and John Howe.

1276
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:19,782
I'm Alan.

1277
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,492
And I'm John. Good afternoon.

1278
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,328
LEE: We basically sit here all day long
doing drawings.

1279
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:27,415
HOWE: Three years of it.
A couple of thousand drawings each.

1280
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,001
And amazingly enough,
we're still having fun.

1281
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:35,756
We see the light at the end of the tunnel,
and we thought for a second...

1282
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,383
...ooh, it might be a train.

1283
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,385
But it turns out it's a dragon.

1284
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:44,265
Come through this way to the model makers.
Our calligrapher, Daniel Reeve.

1285
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,856
And this way to the model makers.

1286
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,443
So we have many models we have to make.

1287
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:59,447
We've done approximately 1 1 5 sets to date...

1288
01:16:59,614 --> 01:17:02,742
...and each one of those sets,
we try to make a model...

1289
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:05,036
...to show Peter
before we begin construction.

1290
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,704
That kind of thing's nice.

1291
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,956
We've got this model
we showed Peter this morning.

1292
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:12,209
There's a few adjustments
we have to make for it.

1293
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:14,628
And then we'll be straight
into construction of this.

1294
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,297
We shoot this in one week's time.

1295
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:25,097
Welcome. We're here on F Stage. Come on in.
That's where Main Unit's shooting today.

1296
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:28,434
We're doing a scene here for Film 1 .
It's a scene in the Troll cave.

1297
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,728
So follow me. We'll come here.

1298
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,813
Zane, our lovely producer.

1299
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,273
Less information....

1300
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:36,942
Ian and Richard leaving.

1301
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,821
And now follow me. We'll go on set,
but, um, quietly. They're rehearsing there.

1302
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:53,084
I'm Corrin, the boom-swinger.
This is Tony, the sound recordist.

1303
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,627
These are some of the newer stages.

1304
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,254
Had sound-proofing,
which makes it fantastic for us...

1305
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:00,091
...being as there's an airport
just over the hill that way.

1306
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,886
ANTS: This is the first production
that's been in here.

1307
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,764
One of the biggest things
is there's head room now.

1308
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:09,141
Guys can walk these walkways
without bumping their head.

1309
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:12,728
I'm a roof-dweller.
Handy if you don't have fear of heights.

1310
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:18,192
Very embarrassing if you drop something.
Costs you two dozen beer.

1311
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,569
WOMAN 1 : All right, shooting.
WOMAN 2: Shooting.

1312
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:24,240
But now we're just gonna, shh, walk away.
They're gonna shoot.

1313
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:27,076
WOMAN 1 :
Three, two, one, action!

1314
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:48,597
Hi, my name's Dion.
I'm head of Technology on The Hobbit.

1315
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,891
Just gonna show you through my office
and my space...

1316
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,811
...known as the Tin Shed. Come on in.

1317
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:57,189
We look after the technology.
Rigs, cameras.

1318
01:18:57,357 --> 01:19:01,402
This rig here is a surface rig
for shooting on water.

1319
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:06,115
Going in the next couple of days to shoot
a very exciting sequence with the Dwarves.

1320
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:10,870
She's all wireless and all made here
in Wellington over the last couple of weeks.

1321
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:15,749
G'day. You've seen some pretty good
technology back there in the Tin Shed.

1322
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,752
Come have a look out here,
because this is pretty basic technology.

1323
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,255
This is where we built
a humongous green screen.

1324
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,548
This is called the Back Lot.

1325
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:26,135
Now, the Back Lot is where
we shoot all sorts of the outdoor scenes.

1326
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:29,096
They could be battle scenes.
They can be wet sets.

1327
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,848
And, obviously, being a green screen...

1328
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,767
...the backgrounds can be changed
later on in postproduction.

1329
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,561
Have a look down here.

1330
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:38,272
Well, now you can see we're on top
of the green screen.

1331
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,109
This rig up here is a rig designed
by Tony Keddy, the key grip.

1332
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,696
This rig holds huge shade cloth
to block the sun off when we're filming here.

1333
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:48,199
We don't want the sun going
in and out of the cloud all day.

1334
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:50,117
Crikey. What's going on down here?

1335
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,662
This is Nine Square.

1336
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:54,914
It's pretty complicated.

1337
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:58,083
Get the ball, hit it to the next player,
get it out of your square quickly.

1338
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,211
Anything on the line is always contentious.

1339
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:03,297
It's all about attitude.
Do not give in. Do not make eye contact.

1340
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:06,467
-Make your call with pride.
-You'll lie your way through.

1341
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,929
-It's always the umpire's call.
-The ref is always right!

1342
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,851
Guys, please. l'm trying to do some--

1343
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:17,937
CROWD:
Aw.

1344
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:21,023
This is where we store the lead weapons.
You can see a multitude of boxes.

1345
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:25,778
Each box is one lead characters weapons.
This is Gloin's box of beauties.

1346
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:28,572
And they belonged to Gimli
in The Lord of the Rings.

1347
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,659
-And Gloin, his father, for The Hobbit.
WOMAN: Action.

1348
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:32,868
FlLl:
Gloin!

1349
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:37,957
They are, in fact, the same axe.
They've just been made in two different sizes.

1350
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:40,876
I think we've now reached about four scales
for every weapon we make.

1351
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:43,879
Probably about time that you went down
to see who made all these weapons.

1352
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:45,881
Weta Workshop.
Very easy, around the corner.

1353
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:47,883
Out the front drive.
Make sure you take a right.

1354
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:51,220
Go past the Thai place, then turn left.
Go all the way down the end of the road.

1355
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:53,764
Don't stop. You'll get to the end.
The road's 90-degree turn.

1356
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,683
You need to turn
or you'll hit Weta Workshop.

1357
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,186
Hey, you guys. Come on in.

1358
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,439
It's, uh, pretty crazy at the moment.
Come on down here.

1359
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,775
All cast weapons end up in cleanup.

1360
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:08,612
This young chap, Alec, is madly trying
to get the axes finished.

1361
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:12,366
Bow strings.
Weapons lined up for the day's painting.

1362
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:17,788
So Kelly's just putting the aging pass
on quite a decent croquet hammer.

1363
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:21,375
Another painting area. This is Models.
The Milling Department.

1364
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:25,170
Injection molding out of this gun.
Spraying. Trimming. Sanding.

1365
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:29,466
Ha, ha. Engineering. Bending. Cutting. Dying.
Sculpting. Mold making.

1366
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,218
Flesh. Baking. Foam fillings.

1367
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:36,557
And then for every one of the lead actors
that has a full prosthetic.

1368
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,809
And, of course, with Bifur, his ax.

1369
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:41,020
We also make scale doubles of these.

1370
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:45,691
Welcome to the Scaley Portacom.
Hi, I'm Callie.

1371
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,693
-I'm Sophie.
-I'm Brendan.

1372
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,820
And this is Bifur, the hopeless romantic.

1373
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:53,449
CALLIE: We're scale doubles,
so we spend a lot of time being short.

1374
01:21:53,616 --> 01:21:55,492
SOPHIE: Yeah.
BRENDAN: We're paid to be short.

1375
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,494
They wanted us for our bodies.

1376
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:00,456
Have you seen
the behind-the-scenes team yet?

1377
01:22:00,623 --> 01:22:04,752
-I know where they are. Follow me.
CALLIE: See you later.

1378
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:06,420
ALL:
Bye!

1379
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:16,638
JACKSON: A long time ago, actually,
before there was....

1380
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:18,599
What are you doing?

1381
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:23,520
I've been filming the blog.
It's like a pet project.

1382
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,356
-Filming the blog?
-Yeah.

1383
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:28,067
That's very good, but shouldn't you
be killing Orcs or something?

1384
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:29,902
-Shouldn't you be directing a movie?
-Yeah.

1385
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,071
Right, so here we are
at the end of the blog.

1386
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:37,534
Hope you've enjoyed this tour around our
little world down here in Miramar, New Zealand.

1387
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:39,536
I hope you particularly enjoyed
the camerawork.

1388
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:41,413
-I thought it was terrific.
-Wonderful.

1389
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:44,541
In fact, I think we should take that wig off
and get you behind the camera.

1390
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:46,710
-I'll take over the role. Don't worry.
-Ha, ha.

1391
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:48,462
-Can l do now?
-You want to be Legolas?

1392
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,881
-Yes, we should get Kiran in as Legolas.
-Yes.

1393
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,258
Kiran as Legolas.
This is a-- lt's a done deal.

1394
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:56,804
Hey, so we're gonna come back
with another blog...

1395
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:59,473
...when we wrap in a few weeks' time,
or shortly after we wrap.

1396
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:04,144
So look forward to, um, our final blog
of our shooting period coming up soon.

1397
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,063
The bitter end. Ha, ha.

1398
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,940
-The happy end.
-The happy end.

1399
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:39,972
JACKSON:
So welcome to our latest blog.

1400
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,724
We're driving to Comic-Con
with butterflies in my stomach.

1401
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:48,230
Presenting footage for the first time is always
a slightly intimidating and scary thing.

1402
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,732
Plus, I've gotta face a day of interviews.

1403
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:55,529
But, um, another 1 0 hours
and it'll all be behind us.

1404
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,578
Hey. Whoo!

1405
01:24:03,746 --> 01:24:06,790
So hopefully we'll, uh, find Ian and Richard
in here somewhere.

1406
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,170
The Hobbit certainly is more funny.
One interview down.

1407
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:19,511
When I call you guys up on-stage--

1408
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,513
-Are we coming out one at a time?
-Yes.

1409
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,849
I saw on The One Ring this morning...

1410
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:27,311
...that people have been camping out
since Wednesday to get into Hall H.

1411
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:30,939
Those are the sorts of people
that I like hanging out with.

1412
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,608
I'm gonna be going on soon.

1413
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:37,738
And I've been recruited to do
some blog filming with my iPhone.

1414
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,157
Because this camera isn't allowed on-stage.

1415
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,702
But nobody is gonna stop me
shooting with my iPhone.

1416
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:02,679
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
to the stage, Peter Jackson.

1417
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,563
Let's bring up a few of our friends
that we have here.

1418
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,315
Philippa Boyens.

1419
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:14,942
Andy Serkis.

1420
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:16,693
Richard Armitage.

1421
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:18,570
Martin Freeman.

1422
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:20,239
Sir Ian McKellen.

1423
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:23,242
We also have a surprise guest,
Elijah Wood.

1424
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:29,831
I love you guys. I came all the way
from Brazil just because of you.

1425
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,041
MAN:
Thank you.

1426
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,961
I spent all my money on this trip,
but it was worth it.

1427
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,547
JACKSON: These are the people
that we're making the film for.

1428
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:39,424
And I'm really happy that it was received
in such a great way.

1429
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:42,010
I'd like you to do something
for the people that couldn't be here.

1430
01:25:42,178 --> 01:25:45,055
Could you just say, "Hi, from Comic-Con."

1431
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,431
One, two, three.

1432
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:49,434
CROWD:
Hi from Comic-Con!

1433
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:51,103
JACKSON:
There you go.

1434
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:54,398
Fantastic. No need for take two,
that was bloody good.

1435
01:25:54,566 --> 01:26:01,196
And so now, we would like to show you a little
bit of what we showed the audience in Hall H.

1436
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:12,332
-That's great.
-Cut. Cool.

1437
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:19,423
Welcome to the last five days of our shoot.

1438
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:22,175
It's a bittersweet kind of moment.

1439
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,386
It feels like l'm still at the foot
of the mountain.

1440
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:26,972
It's difficult to do a wrap out
on our last bit of shooting...

1441
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,308
...because so much
of what we've been doing recently...

1442
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:32,519
...has been Film 2,
which is obviously secret.

1443
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:36,857
But, um, we'll show you little bits and pieces.
Little snippets.

1444
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:41,403
And there'll be a lot more of what we've
been doing that we'll save up for future blogs.

1445
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:47,659
Hey, Comic-Con fans. How are you? This is
Dori, coming live from the set of The Hobbit.

1446
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:49,411
Stay classy, San Diego.

1447
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:53,415
Hi, Comic-Con. John Callen here.
I play Oin in The Hobbit.

1448
01:26:57,253 --> 01:27:00,088
Hi, this is Dwalin saying a big hi
to all of you in Comic-Con.

1449
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:03,592
Greetings from the very heart
of Middle-earth.

1450
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,346
A really amazing moment for me, l guess,
was the first time we stepped onto Bag-end.

1451
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:10,849
It's become so embedded in your psyche
from what you've seen before.

1452
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,559
We're all ready to go...

1453
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,354
...and Ian came on for the first time.

1454
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:20,108
And you look at him and you go,
"My God, that's Gandalf."

1455
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:24,112
I look back with fondness,
we got to know each other on Bag-end.

1456
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,823
-We really got to know each other as Dwarves.
ALL: Ha-ha-ha.

1457
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:32,162
Hi, Comic-Con. It's Adam Brown here,
aka Ori from The Hobbit set.

1458
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:36,583
One of the most exciting things,
I think, for me...

1459
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:40,212
...was working on these sets
that are kind of a part of our history.

1460
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:44,549
And there was I working on Rivendell
with some incredible actors.

1461
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,553
Just watching Cate Blanchett act,
it was very moving.

1462
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:50,764
We had shivers down our spines.

1463
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,100
It was absolutely astonishing.

1464
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:55,185
It's been a privilege
being back in Middle-earth.

1465
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:59,940
I hope you're having a good time.
My name is Lee Pace.

1466
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,484
I play the Elven King, Thranduil.

1467
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:05,112
Some of the work that l really loved
was with Terry Notary...

1468
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:07,656
...who designs movement
for the different races.

1469
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:11,576
And the way the Elves move is very different
than the way the Dwarves move, obviously.

1470
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:17,374
It was really fun to get into that character
and really move in a way that is not human.

1471
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,501
Yeah.

1472
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:24,047
Sylvester, who played Radagast,
is the loveliest man.

1473
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:25,966
I need people.

1474
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:30,929
I think that Sylvester is gonna be
one of the delights of these movies.

1475
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:33,348
The real McCoy.

1476
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:34,891
I remember going out to Trentham...

1477
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:37,477
...and wandering through
1 00 meters of forest they built...

1478
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:41,064
...and seeing Rhosgobel,
which is Radagast's house.

1479
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:45,444
Radagast's character
was a lovely spirited wizard...

1480
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:49,406
...and his house really reflected
his character beautifully.

1481
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:56,163
Dale was beautiful.
It was like being in another country.

1482
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:58,749
HOPE: lt was very Moroccan, Turkish...
SERKlS: Moroccan.

1483
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:01,251
-...Italian.
SERKlS: ltalian. Yes.

1484
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,920
Dale was one of the larger sets.

1485
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:06,631
JACKSON: lt rivaled some of the bigger sets
we've ever built...

1486
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:09,968
...which would have been Minas Tirith
and Helm's Deep, I guess, in the old days.

1487
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:12,929
The city of Dale is such a huge set.

1488
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:14,556
You're able to just wander around...

1489
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:19,186
...as if you were in some abandoned city
you've always wanted to visit.

1490
01:29:19,353 --> 01:29:23,565
The most fun l've had on set
would probably be the Goblins.

1491
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:27,611
Goblin-town, their sets just seemed
to be really sharp and really angular...

1492
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:31,323
...and lots of flames and lots of bones.

1493
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:34,242
We were introduced to the Great Goblin.

1494
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:38,330
Barry Humphries is something
of an iconic legend in this part of the world.

1495
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:42,542
And, uh, l've seen two or three
of his Dame Edna stage shows.

1496
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:46,338
And Barry and the Goblin King
just seemed to be a natural fit.

1497
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:48,965
Have you seen the pile of intestines?

1498
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:50,926
No, but l'll go and check them out.

1499
01:29:51,093 --> 01:29:55,096
I don't know if anyone's home,
but we'll soon see.

1500
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,766
I found Beorn's house
absolutely mesmerizing.

1501
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:02,395
It's one of my favorite parts of the book.
And the creation, the carving that they did...

1502
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:06,149
...inside that beautiful barn,
and everything was so oversized.

1503
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,902
I wanna write the theme tune,
sing the theme tune.

1504
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,947
JACKSON: We built it to the scale
of the Dwarves so it was huge.

1505
01:30:12,114 --> 01:30:13,323
It made all of us feel small.

1506
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:16,827
I used to be able to stand on that set
and look at the crew setting up the camera...

1507
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:20,872
...and they looked like tiny little people.
It was kind of incredible.

1508
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:25,168
Morning, everyone. Happy last day.
Morning.

1509
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,337
What we're doing for this shot
is we're gonna set--

1510
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:28,880
We're gonna get Orlando up on here.

1511
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,218
Somebody stuck something to my back?
What is it?

1512
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:37,472
Second unit, I think we're a bit
of the rock 'n' roll unit. We have fun.

1513
01:30:41,435 --> 01:30:44,062
Greg's shorts, l think. They have to be on.

1514
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:47,983
Just loop it, bro. Just loop it. No problem.

1515
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:50,485
-I'm disturbed.
-It's like an 8-year-old schoolboy.

1516
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:52,654
What do you mean,
it's like an 8-year-old schoolboy?

1517
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,125
He's a rock star.

1518
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,502
JACKSON:
He has got energy to burn.

1519
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,297
And that infectious enthusiasm
and his absolute dedication...

1520
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,340
...made a huge difference to the second unit.

1521
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:13,800
And crank it up.

1522
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,511
And in three, two, one, action.

1523
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:21,308
And cut.

1524
01:31:21,475 --> 01:31:24,936
That is a wrap for the second unit.

1525
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,691
Second unit.

1526
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,944
Mixture of emotions.

1527
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:35,572
It's good to finish, but sad.

1528
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:39,576
Quite frankly, l can't imagine this occurring
anywhere else on the planet...

1529
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,494
...so thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1530
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,668
One of the memories
that really sticks in my head the most...

1531
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:54,341
...is walking in through the gates of Stone
Street at 4:45 in the morning when it's dark...

1532
01:31:54,508 --> 01:31:57,010
...and there's no one else here
and the stars are still out.

1533
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:00,764
And then slowly the studio comes to life
and the sun comes up.

1534
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,515
I saw a lot of those days.

1535
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:05,936
You're getting up at 5:30
for a year and a half.

1536
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,438
-At least 1 2 hours a day.
-Morning.

1537
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,024
You literally just wake up every morning
and go shoot a movie.

1538
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,360
And it seems to last a lifetime.

1539
01:32:13,527 --> 01:32:16,738
This is the kind of movie,
changes everybody's lives.

1540
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:19,074
What we do is kind of driven by adrenaline...

1541
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:22,786
-...so we keep going until we collapse.
-Ha, ha.

1542
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:28,208
We've got ready about 20 people a day
and that's about 5000 prosthetic makeups.

1543
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,461
It's not gonna work. lt's not in line. Ow!

1544
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,005
We're busy,
but sometimes we get bored being busy.

1545
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,885
In the last 18 months,
we've gone through 20 liters of glue.

1546
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:41,346
About 450 miles of yak hair.

1547
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:44,391
Hence there are now a lot of cold yaks
in the Himalayas somewhere.

1548
01:32:44,558 --> 01:32:46,267
I've never worked on such a hairy movie.

1549
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:49,688
Even I'm sporting a beard.
Never had a beard before.

1550
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:52,565
So it's obviously rubbing off
somewhere along the line.

1551
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:55,777
The amount of lead characters
with costumes.

1552
01:32:55,945 --> 01:33:00,240
For some reason, they all wanna wear costumes.
They all want pants. They all want shoes...

1553
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,993
...made for an enormous amount
of costumes.

1554
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:09,040
All of these clothes
to nearly the back of the truck is Bilbo.

1555
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:13,378
Smaug's lair, we use so much gold paint,
used everything in Australasia.

1556
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:15,296
We had to get it from Germany. Wunderbar.

1557
01:33:15,464 --> 01:33:21,386
22,817,520 feet...

1558
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:25,181
...if we were shooting 35 mil like this,
and I'm really glad we're not.

1559
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:30,311
I'm sure that l've done over 2500 drawings.
I kept my pencil stubs.

1560
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:34,858
You're literally doing the drawing one day
and then walking on the sets a few days later.

1561
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:39,863
We shoot a set, take it out
and replace it for the very next day's shoot.

1562
01:33:40,364 --> 01:33:42,157
JACKSON:
They put up the most incredible sets.

1563
01:33:42,324 --> 01:33:44,743
You walk in the night before,
it's not finished and you think:

1564
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:48,204
"My God, how are we ever gonna
be in here tomorrow filming?"

1565
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:50,749
You walk in 8:00 the next morning
and it's ready to go.

1566
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:55,879
To me that's probably one of the most
gratifying things on this whole picture.

1567
01:33:56,047 --> 01:34:01,885
That all these people force through impossible
odds and create these beautiful things.

1568
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:05,638
-Wow, look at that.
MAN: Yes.

1569
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:09,768
I'll miss the camaraderie of the folks
that we've built up, and the cast and crew.

1570
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:11,895
You know, we've spent
an awful long time together.

1571
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:16,566
There's, like, sort of 12 or 1 3 of us
who have been in a mini army.

1572
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,827
Well, I mean, they're all people
I would love to work with again. Fantastic cast.

1573
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,538
You bastard.

1574
01:34:30,706 --> 01:34:33,500
I'm surrounded by these mates.
I'm surrounded by my comrades.

1575
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:35,376
I'm surrounded by these great actors.

1576
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:41,883
Please, not every time. Get off.
God, they're so-- I mean....

1577
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:46,554
You get so close that you're, um, able
to freely abuse them on a daily basis...

1578
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:48,014
...and they don't seem to mind.

1579
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:49,682
FREEMAN:
And that's the poster.

1580
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,647
There are a very high quality
of human beings involved.

1581
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:58,233
Soon, we won't be together as a gang.

1582
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,777
Which is gonna be sad.
We'll miss each other terribly.

1583
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:04,405
You're getting to come to work with a group
of people that you love working with...

1584
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:07,742
...that you love hanging out with.
It's a real family.

1585
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,161
What's this in our laundry?

1586
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:13,498
Look at that. Oh! Ha-ha-ha!

1587
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,542
My undies.

1588
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:17,418
Red-handed.

1589
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:20,004
What happens on The Hobbit
stays on The Hobbit. Ha, ha.

1590
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:30,807
JACKSON:
Finishing up on Mirkwood today, eh?

1591
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,767
It's the old, you know, finish with a bang.

1592
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,238
Look out.

1593
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:00,128
MAN 1 : l'm gonna miss you.
MAN 2: l'm gonna miss you, man.

1594
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,175
Ow. Ow!

1595
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:12,348
Okay, and action.

1596
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:15,101
GANDALF: l need a horse.
MAN 1 : Why? Where are you going?

1597
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:16,769
GANDALF:
In search of answers.

1598
01:36:17,396 --> 01:36:18,438
All right, and cut.

1599
01:36:22,776 --> 01:36:26,529
Well, unless anybody has anything else
they wanna shoot...

1600
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:28,698
...I think we should call it a day. Thank you.

1601
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,470
Well, obviously, l just want
to say thank you to everybody.

1602
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,263
An incredible cast. An incredible crew.

1603
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:56,476
Seems like a lifetime ago that I had to do
this speech at the beginning of the shoot.

1604
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,062
Oh, God, that was a long time ago.

1605
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,398
You know, as a director,
it can be kind of a lonely job.

1606
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:06,527
Um, you know, at times you feel like you're
by yourself trying to solve problems.

1607
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:08,363
But then everybody steps in...

1608
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:10,907
...and suddenly I realize
I've got this incredible support...

1609
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:13,743
...and all of you guys have got my back
and you're behind me.

1610
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:16,746
And for that l'm incredibly grateful.
Thank you.

1611
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,711
MAN:
Yeah, l think there's bubbles right next door.

1612
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,344
JACKSON: lt's been a terrific atmosphere
shooting this movie.

1613
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:37,350
And I hope the blogs have, in some way,
given you all a chance to share in that...

1614
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,936
...and to experience it for yourselves.

1615
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,230
And we'll be continuing in postproduction.

1616
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:46,359
The energy, the environment,
everything's gonna be very, very different...

1617
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,736
...but it's still got
an equal amount of challenges.

1618
01:37:48,904 --> 01:37:53,157
So look forward to seeing you
during postproduction.

1619
01:37:54,076 --> 01:37:56,327
It's just lemonade. Honestly.

1620
01:37:56,495 --> 01:37:59,497
Come on, show some love.
Put your arm around the person next to you.

1621
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:19,851
Show me.

1622
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,107
Welcome to the theater at Park Road Post.

1623
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:28,693
This is our postproduction facility
in Wellington.

1624
01:38:28,902 --> 01:38:31,779
And this is where we're spending
a huge amount of time at the moment...

1625
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,282
...just working on getting
The Hobbit finished.

1626
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:38,536
It's due to be completed literally two days
before the premiere.

1627
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:41,080
Hopefully. Ha, ha.

1628
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:43,833
So we'll give you a look at
where we're at with postproduction.

1629
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:47,170
You're gonna see a lot of
sleep-deprived people in this blog.

1630
01:38:47,379 --> 01:38:50,131
Everyone's working around the clock
to get the film finished.

1631
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,842
So everything begins at Editorial.

1632
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,136
BEST:
So here's the Bunker, Editorial.

1633
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:58,431
I am Dan Best.
I'm the first assistant editor on The Hobbit.

1634
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,224
So next door to us is the Cutting Room.

1635
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:03,227
Jabez and Peter are in there,
busy cutting film two at the moment.

1636
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:08,232
JACKSON: We were shooting this
with 1 50 people on the set.

1637
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:13,696
And then here we are sitting here and it
just comes down to Jabez and l. Two of us.

1638
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:17,658
The last two men standing,
uh, get to edit the movie.

1639
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:21,245
So it's quite a relaxing
and enjoyable process.

1640
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:24,665
And while you're putting that together,
I'm gonna make another cup of tea.

1641
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,794
When Jabez has something very simple
to do that doesn't need me around...

1642
01:39:27,961 --> 01:39:30,838
...I get the cups, go make a cup of tea
and come back and it's all done.

1643
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:32,131
Very good.

1644
01:39:34,259 --> 01:39:38,179
Hey, welcome to Previs. Come on in.
Christian's just down this way.

1645
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:42,683
We're the front-end creative team
that Pete uses to design a lot of his shots.

1646
01:39:42,851 --> 01:39:47,230
We are animating the camera
and the characters around...

1647
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:52,652
...to form what's kind of like 3D storyboards,
almost at a video-game level.

1648
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:55,446
RlVERS:
Typically, you do previs before you shoot.

1649
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:59,617
Obviously, they finished principal photography
and we're still previs'ing a few shots.

1650
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,078
We've just got a shot
turned over from Peter.

1651
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:04,080
This is what we get from Editorial
sometimes.

1652
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:08,126
Basically we get a blank card that says
something like, "CG wide shot.

1653
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:11,504
Goblins slowly move torture machines
towards the Great Goblin's platform."

1654
01:40:11,713 --> 01:40:13,631
We gotta turn this stuff around
pretty quickly.

1655
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,216
It's Christian over here at Previs.

1656
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:18,553
We just got a shot turned over that,
we need some torture machines. Cheers.

1657
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:20,555
Usually they're pretty quick.
Here we go.

1658
01:40:20,764 --> 01:40:24,392
We have from Weta Workshop
some torture machine designs.

1659
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:27,019
We need to get these modeled
pretty quick, guys.

1660
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:29,147
-It'll only be a minute or two.
-Yeah, a minute.

1661
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:33,734
-Jerry, what are you doing?
-I'm making a 3D extravaganza.

1662
01:40:36,738 --> 01:40:40,074
It wouldn't be a good shot
if you didn't have sound effects, so: Aah!

1663
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:43,202
-The models coming through yet?
MAN: Yeah, here it is.

1664
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:46,164
-Jerry, can we get textures on that?
-Sure, no problem. Already on it.

1665
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:47,748
-Already on it?
RlVERS: Almost done.

1666
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:51,377
So the thing is we've gotta turn
this stuff around pretty quickly...

1667
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:54,005
...because, you know, the film delivers
in, like, eight weeks.

1668
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:55,339
What do you do, Eric?

1669
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:57,800
Uh, I just stare at code all day.

1670
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:04,265
So you got your torture machines.
How's the shot going?

1671
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:07,727
Yeah, sorry it took so long,
but l think this is gonna work.

1672
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:12,398
Very cool. No, it looks good. We should
send it to Pete and see what he says.

1673
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:15,443
It'll be a really cool moment.
That's good, yes.

1674
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:19,280
Just got PJ notes.
We're off to, um, talk to a few supervisors...

1675
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:22,283
...about what we have to do now
on a few extra shots.

1676
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:25,661
This is the original building
we had on Rings.

1677
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:28,289
For hobbit, now we've expanded
to eight different buildings.

1678
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:31,375
-This used to be an insane asylum.
-Yes. Used to be an insane asylum.

1679
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:34,670
Still, days like this, it feels like it even so.

1680
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:39,300
We're at the six-and-a-half week mark.

1681
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,094
Um, not much time left to finish this one.

1682
01:41:42,304 --> 01:41:43,554
We're at Wexford Road now.

1683
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:47,058
This is the original production office
for Lord of the Rings.

1684
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:50,311
But now it's the home of all the animators
for Hobbit.

1685
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:54,065
Troll sequence,
definitely one of the biggest challenges.

1686
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:56,651
They're speaking,
which is something new for Trolls.

1687
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:59,654
Are there any more of you little fellas
hiding where you shouldn't?

1688
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:00,905
No.

1689
01:42:01,114 --> 01:42:03,115
-In Rings, they're always only grunting.
-Yeah.

1690
01:42:05,827 --> 01:42:07,954
CLYTON:
Peter shot it live-action on the mocap stage.

1691
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:12,083
Are there any more of you little fellas
hiding where you shouldn't?

1692
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:13,417
Pete liked the action...

1693
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:17,797
...but wanted to go a little bit bigger
on what the stunt guys were doing.

1694
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:20,091
So maybe we do a custom mocap shoot
with those bits?

1695
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,051
MAN:
Action.

1696
01:42:24,346 --> 01:42:27,807
That felt good. l'm happy with that.
Okay, should we move on?

1697
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:32,186
We've advanced the art of motion capture
quite substantially on The Hobbit...

1698
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:38,109
...uh, including the detail of motion-capturing
individual hairs of Dwarfs' beards.

1699
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:42,071
Come on in. Welcome to
the Department of lnternal Beard-Hairs.

1700
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,490
We're gonna tell you about what we do.

1701
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:46,909
Kev, can we get you to paint, please?

1702
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:51,747
-Having beards on set is dangerous.
-Incredibly. We've lost a lot of good beards.

1703
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:55,585
Right, so we've created a virtual beard
in the computer and what this allows us to do--

1704
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:58,129
-Whoa, layman's terms, please.
-Sorry. Sorry.

1705
01:42:58,338 --> 01:43:01,340
We have a beard in the computer.

1706
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,719
Motivation here: it's dark, it's stormy.
You're in the mountains.

1707
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:09,515
Action. Wind. Rain. Lightning bolts.

1708
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:10,766
And cut.

1709
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:13,144
So this looks great. Can we go ahead
and propagate this?

1710
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:16,939
Right. So what I can do is just
by pushing this one button here....

1711
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:20,484
And voila, you can see that the beard has
now been propagated throughout the film.

1712
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,486
It's the power of beard-capture technology.

1713
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:25,031
-Nice work, guys.
-Good job, everybody.

1714
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:28,909
I don't think there's anybody
working harder at the moment, probably...

1715
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:33,289
...than the Weta digital artists who have got
several hundred CGl shots to do...

1716
01:43:33,498 --> 01:43:35,291
...in the last few weeks of postproduction.

1717
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:38,002
We have a lot of shots to deliver each week.

1718
01:43:38,211 --> 01:43:41,172
In fact, the most shots
Weta has really ever delivered.

1719
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:44,634
-Good luck. Let's break the record.
-Have a great week.

1720
01:43:46,428 --> 01:43:48,179
It's Saturday at Wexford Road.

1721
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,558
The first thing we have to do each morning
is release the animators.

1722
01:43:52,768 --> 01:43:55,227
So should we do that? Are we ready?

1723
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:58,439
-Are they there?
MAN: Wake up!

1724
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:00,816
-It's time!
MAN: Wakey, wakey!

1725
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:04,445
Come on, sleep is for the weak!
Sleep is for the weak!

1726
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:06,697
CLYTON:
Don't get dressed.

1727
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:10,201
If people don't have to leave,
we're happy for them to stay.

1728
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:12,787
We have people that give massages here.

1729
01:44:12,996 --> 01:44:14,705
We actually do laundry for people.

1730
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,291
-They get three meals.
-Scrambled eggs. Yum.

1731
01:44:17,876 --> 01:44:21,212
Conceptual artists eat when they can.

1732
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:23,422
A concept artist's work is never done...

1733
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:25,966
LEE:
...especially on a big effects movie like this.

1734
01:44:26,134 --> 01:44:30,554
We're still conceptualizing
after having been here for three years.

1735
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:34,016
HOWE: As long as there's still a shot
that has an empty spot...

1736
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:38,979
...whether it's green or whether it needs
something in front, you just keep at it.

1737
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:44,276
And we're painfully conscious that behind us
are considerable teams of people...

1738
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:47,238
...awaiting for artwork
to do the 3D and the texturing...

1739
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:48,989
...and the lighting and the animation.

1740
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:54,704
The big house where we're going now
is where we've put in the Goblin team.

1741
01:44:54,913 --> 01:44:57,456
That's the Goblin Mobile right there,
Chris White's vehicle.

1742
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:59,917
MAN: lt's exactly the same car
my grandmother has.

1743
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:04,130
SHERWOOD:
It was apparently a reform school.

1744
01:45:04,339 --> 01:45:06,632
People tell me they see ghosts in here.

1745
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,051
There's claw marks in the basement.

1746
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:10,803
So come in if you dare.

1747
01:45:21,022 --> 01:45:25,234
So what Peter was looking for was
to create this whole world underground.

1748
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:29,196
So we're creating this Goblin-town
with all these different structures...

1749
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:33,451
...and light and walkways and fires,
and so this is some of the work in progress.

1750
01:45:33,618 --> 01:45:37,121
A lot of what we're doing on this guy
is beauty lighting.

1751
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:40,791
Because we've gotta really highlight
all of his warts and all that good stuff.

1752
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,586
He's quite hideous,
but he has to look beautiful at the same time.

1753
01:45:43,795 --> 01:45:46,297
JACKSON: Here at Park Road Post Production,
down the corridor...

1754
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:49,884
...we've got Andrew Lesnie, our DP,
doing the color timing of the film.

1755
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:51,594
Hi. And welcome to the Dl.

1756
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:58,476
Um, yesterday, we made chicken laksa
and today we're going to cook up pad thai.

1757
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:00,352
Dl is short for "digital intermediate."

1758
01:46:00,562 --> 01:46:03,481
This is part of a process
which is called the color grading.

1759
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:06,358
It is like Photoshop for motion pictures.

1760
01:46:06,568 --> 01:46:09,487
This is the exterior of Bag-end.

1761
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:12,198
We filmed this shot in Matamata.

1762
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,658
We didn't have the most ideal weather
on the day...

1763
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:16,786
...but the landscape is still very beautiful.

1764
01:46:16,995 --> 01:46:21,040
So we actually are just working
the original material on this one.

1765
01:46:21,374 --> 01:46:24,043
Essentially, what we do
is we start with the plate...

1766
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:27,588
...and then we're building up
basically a layered grade...

1767
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:29,924
...and the result is what you see there.

1768
01:46:30,133 --> 01:46:33,344
We also have these dueling lasers
so that we can do this.

1769
01:46:33,553 --> 01:46:35,971
-This bit of grass right there, yeah.
-This bit?

1770
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:39,475
Distinct from this bit over here. Ha, ha.

1771
01:46:39,684 --> 01:46:41,352
We've got these lights up for the blog...

1772
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:44,563
...but traditionally we work in
a much darker environment.

1773
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:50,444
And, um, we actually work in an environment
that's, in fact, even darker than this...

1774
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:52,321
...but mimics a cinema.

1775
01:46:57,452 --> 01:46:59,245
Hi. You're at Park Road Post.

1776
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:01,747
And, uh, this is where we're doing
the sound for The Hobbit.

1777
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:03,624
Uh, let's go and have a look.

1778
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:09,880
Gollum, gollum.

1779
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:14,051
We start the day with a dance.
That's the first thing we do in Sound.

1780
01:47:14,636 --> 01:47:17,137
And we hand along.
Chris, take the floor.

1781
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:19,890
-We do the fader dance.
WHITEHEAD: Fader dance, yeah.

1782
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:25,896
You can see Dave's cut 1 6 layers of sounds
for this Goblin.

1783
01:47:26,231 --> 01:47:29,900
And he's done such a cool job that....

1784
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,696
See what else l can do to it,
which is fun and challenging.

1785
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:38,492
I think a lot of people don't understand
about how a film gets made.

1786
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:43,163
How many people it takes to piece
a soundtrack together. We have dialogue.

1787
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:44,415
Elves.

1788
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:46,417
FARMER:
We have music.

1789
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:49,336
And in sound effects alone,
we break into several categories.

1790
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:54,466
Standard sound effects:
Swords, body falls, doors, things like that.

1791
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:57,261
We have ambiances,
which is like some wind.

1792
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:59,179
We have some crowd sounds,
things like that.

1793
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:00,389
Run!

1794
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:05,102
What we're doing today is we put out a friends
and family and other departments call...

1795
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:11,025
...to come down and be panicked villagers
for Dale for when it gets desolated by Smaug.

1796
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:16,280
That's how we rock it in Sound Post here.

1797
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:20,826
Right. And here Matt's cutting the crowds...

1798
01:48:22,245 --> 01:48:25,039
...and all that sort of stuff. Grr!

1799
01:48:25,248 --> 01:48:27,041
We're on our way.

1800
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,879
Feels like a scene from The Shining
down this hallway.

1801
01:48:32,088 --> 01:48:34,006
I really wish l had a tricycle.

1802
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:38,052
Foley.

1803
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:40,137
They got the best-sounding door.

1804
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:46,143
Foley's a specific part of the soundtrack
which relates to humans.

1805
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:51,815
Anything associated with what they touch
and how they move is recorded by these guys.

1806
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:55,069
Get to bash stuff, break stuff.

1807
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:57,321
Drag it, stretch it, bend it.

1808
01:48:58,406 --> 01:49:00,074
What makes a great foley track...

1809
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:04,161
...is often the interpretation of the sound
rather than the sound itself.

1810
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:10,459
Goblin claws.

1811
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:12,169
It's just banjo picks.

1812
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:14,713
Makes it very awkward
when you go to the toilet.

1813
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,311
Welcome to Abbey Road Studio One.

1814
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:33,482
This is the place where we make all these
fabulous soundtracks, including The Hobbit.

1815
01:49:33,692 --> 01:49:36,986
And that's what we're doing today.
We're back in the studio for a record day.

1816
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:38,821
Full orchestra today.

1817
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:42,449
ELLlOTT:
There'll be 93 people in their various sections.

1818
01:49:42,617 --> 01:49:45,494
This is Howard's conductor's podium.

1819
01:49:45,704 --> 01:49:48,539
So this is where he stands
and directs the orchestra from.

1820
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:52,167
Abbey Road is legendary
with its microphone collection.

1821
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:56,588
So here's one that John Lennon sang into
when he was a recording artist at the studio.

1822
01:49:56,798 --> 01:49:59,174
I've never had a shot with one here.

1823
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:00,676
Can you get that?

1824
01:50:00,885 --> 01:50:04,346
ELLlOTT: The musicians receive the music
for the first time.

1825
01:50:04,556 --> 01:50:06,765
They don't rehearse it or anything like that.

1826
01:50:06,975 --> 01:50:10,686
They just turn up, the sheet music
is in front of them and they play.

1827
01:50:12,147 --> 01:50:16,775
This is rather important to make sure
these get onto the podium.

1828
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,235
Here's the control room.

1829
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:20,946
It's an adrenaline rush
to be looking out at the orchestra...

1830
01:50:21,156 --> 01:50:25,576
...that we're kind of in control
of this fabulous sound.

1831
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,018
You're right. We're happy with that.
Let's take a break.

1832
01:50:58,109 --> 01:51:01,320
Theater 2. This is the final mix room.
This is where it all comes together.

1833
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:02,738
MAN:
Well.

1834
01:51:02,947 --> 01:51:04,448
Look who it is.

1835
01:51:04,949 --> 01:51:08,160
BOYES:
We all arrived with tons and tons of sounds.

1836
01:51:08,369 --> 01:51:13,207
Then in the final mix we have to figure out
what sound makes sense, what sound doesn't.

1837
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:18,754
You could put a horse vocal on the shot
to let us know we're there.

1838
01:51:18,963 --> 01:51:24,635
BOYES: But at the end of the day, hopefully
we've got clarity and we are telling the story.

1839
01:51:24,844 --> 01:51:26,637
And I have to say it's really fun.

1840
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:31,850
We got another three weeks and then....
Um, and another couple films.

1841
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:34,853
So the journey's long from over.
It's just really starting.

1842
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:37,898
GOLLUM:
Yes, yes.

1843
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:39,817
So that's what's happening at the moment.

1844
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:42,986
The premiere is very, very close.

1845
01:51:43,196 --> 01:51:45,114
But fortunately, people are staying calm.

1846
01:51:49,744 --> 01:51:53,080
They're staying incredibly disciplined.
Focusing on their work.

1847
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,795
We are blessed to have
such a sane, sensible team.

1848
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,303
So there we have it.

1849
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:11,932
Gives you a taste of where we are,
but we will catch up with you very, very soon.

1850
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:15,727
And invite you to come along and have
a look at our experience at the premieres.

1851
01:52:30,952 --> 01:52:32,828
-All right, cool.
-Good morning.

1852
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:36,290
JACKSON: Welcome to our new blog.
It's been a very busy final few days.

1853
01:52:36,457 --> 01:52:39,668
On Sunday we showed Peter
the last shot of the movie.

1854
01:52:39,878 --> 01:52:42,045
Our last delivery shot
and the last shot of the movie.

1855
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:44,381
-That's the one. Heh, heh, heh.
-Okay.

1856
01:52:44,549 --> 01:52:46,133
-There's always a last shot.
-Fantastic.

1857
01:52:46,342 --> 01:52:48,677
JACKSON: We kind of finished the movie
Sunday morning.

1858
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:51,138
-That'll do it.
JACKSON: And just a few hours later...

1859
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:54,266
...a room full ofjournalists
showed up to see it.

1860
01:52:54,475 --> 01:52:56,435
You'd say that it was dripping wet.

1861
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:58,395
It was digitally dripping wet.

1862
01:52:58,563 --> 01:53:00,647
Funny, the day the press
started watching...

1863
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:02,900
...to know we're still working.

1864
01:53:03,067 --> 01:53:05,819
JACKSON: So should we have lunch
and then you guys can.... Right?

1865
01:53:05,987 --> 01:53:07,905
-Congratulations.
WOMAN 1 : Yeah, thank you.

1866
01:53:08,114 --> 01:53:10,032
MAN: Yeah.
WOMAN 2: Good job.

1867
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:14,036
JACKSON: More work on the Dolby Atmos mix.
That finished yesterday morning.

1868
01:53:14,245 --> 01:53:16,663
BILBO: Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

1869
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:19,291
BOWLlNG:
So we're here at the Embassy Theatre.

1870
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,336
Had a complete retrofit for Dolby Atmos.

1871
01:53:22,545 --> 01:53:25,214
So there are 36
total surround speakers in here.

1872
01:53:25,381 --> 01:53:29,509
There are 28 around the audience,
and then there are eight overhead surrounds.

1873
01:53:29,677 --> 01:53:34,681
We can now uniquely place sounds
either around the audience, and even above.

1874
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:38,936
But we can also have this really smooth
360-degree movement of sound.

1875
01:53:39,938 --> 01:53:41,688
Well, that's good. l think that solves it.

1876
01:53:41,856 --> 01:53:44,399
MAN 1 : That's much better, yeah.
MAN 2: Much better.

1877
01:53:44,567 --> 01:53:47,194
Welcome to our temporary once
set up for the organization...

1878
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:49,905
...of The Hobbit world premiere.

1879
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:51,907
There's probably about 1500 people, I think.

1880
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:55,827
In here and at the council, Art Department,
all getting ready frantically...

1881
01:53:56,037 --> 01:53:58,163
...to have everything in place for the big day.

1882
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:01,083
There's lots of fun things
about working in Middle-earth.

1883
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:04,920
One of the coolest is actually getting
to the few weeks before the premiere.

1884
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:07,422
Because you get to build things like this.

1885
01:54:07,966 --> 01:54:11,385
We're doing another Gollum.
This is for our local airport.

1886
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:17,891
It will be suspended on the roof, welcoming
all of the guests that come along to Wellington.

1887
01:54:18,101 --> 01:54:21,019
It's been a frantic night, but we're done.

1888
01:54:24,607 --> 01:54:28,568
As in tradition there will be something
adorned to the top of the Embassy...

1889
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,195
...especially for the premiere.

1890
01:54:30,363 --> 01:54:35,325
So our idea right from the beginning was
to make a large-scale version of Gandalf...

1891
01:54:35,493 --> 01:54:37,953
...making his mark on the green door
at Bag-end...

1892
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:40,580
...which really was the start of the journey.

1893
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:43,542
This element here
is the background to the stage.

1894
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:49,673
So on the day, we'll install this in such a way
that it creates a forced-perspective element.

1895
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:54,511
So looking through a camera lens,
Gandalf will be the same height as me.

1896
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:56,847
-I'm so excited!
-Aah!

1897
01:54:57,056 --> 01:54:58,724
The city has definitely got hobbit fever.

1898
01:54:58,933 --> 01:55:02,894
And it just really adds to the whole atmosphere
of the premiere, and we can't wait.

1899
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:05,230
There was just The Hobbit everywhere.

1900
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:08,775
Massive banners, flags all down the streets.

1901
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:14,031
Just a fantastic place. We got to go
to The Hobbit market. Wonderful.

1902
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:18,243
What we've got going on here
is we've set up a market in Waitangi Park.

1903
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:20,370
This is where all the prop makers...

1904
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:22,998
...fabrics people who made stuff
for The Hobbit...

1905
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:26,543
...everyone's gonna display
what their night job actually is.

1906
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:30,797
We're almost on the eve of the premiere, and
very exciting time, of course, for everybody.

1907
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:37,971
It's great catching up with all these guys.

1908
01:55:38,139 --> 01:55:40,766
Isn't it great? lt's like the boys
are all back together again.

1909
01:55:40,933 --> 01:55:42,559
Bad, bad, naughty, boarding school.

1910
01:55:43,895 --> 01:55:46,021
-Beatings.
-Your buttocks are so firm.

1911
01:55:46,647 --> 01:55:48,106
HUNTER:
It's great to be back in town.

1912
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:51,860
Now, there is an energy,
there's a buzz, something's happening.

1913
01:55:55,782 --> 01:55:58,867
It was a great night last night.
The only problem was the emcee...

1914
01:55:59,035 --> 01:56:01,453
-...was just a little bit....
-He was a bit rubbish.

1915
01:56:01,621 --> 01:56:04,289
KIRCHER: Who was the emcee?
HAMBLETON: Some guy called Jed Brody.

1916
01:56:04,457 --> 01:56:06,792
BROPHY: We have some very special guests
with us here this evening.

1917
01:56:06,959 --> 01:56:08,668
Mr. Peter Jackson and Mr. Elijah Wood.

1918
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:13,882
Hello.

1919
01:56:16,052 --> 01:56:18,470
Again, thanks very much for all your support.
A huge amount.

1920
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:21,515
WOMAN: Thank you!
CROWD: Thank you!

1921
01:56:22,642 --> 01:56:26,520
It was run by the fans for the fans, really.
And they got dressed up to the nines.

1922
01:56:29,774 --> 01:56:31,149
Just coming up to the airport now.

1923
01:56:31,317 --> 01:56:34,319
Looking forward to seeing ourselves
on an airplane. Doesn't happen every day.

1924
01:56:34,487 --> 01:56:36,613
NESBlTT: They're giving us
one of these planes each.

1925
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:38,615
Yeah, l've got one. lt's about that big.

1926
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:40,867
No, Richard and Martin
are getting live-scale ones.

1927
01:56:44,288 --> 01:56:45,497
Whoo!

1928
01:56:45,665 --> 01:56:48,834
NESBlTT: We're all also very excited to see
the remaining Dwarves who are coming.

1929
01:56:49,001 --> 01:56:50,919
MAN: Yeah.
NESBlTT: Disembarking from the plane.

1930
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:53,547
We haven't seen them for a long time.
Dean O'Gorman...

1931
01:56:53,714 --> 01:56:57,134
...Graham, Aidan Turner.
You know, it's very exciting.

1932
01:56:57,301 --> 01:57:00,220
This morning a giant plane
from Air New Zealand landed at Wellington.

1933
01:57:00,388 --> 01:57:03,390
We had all the talent out there for that.
I think they're excited to be back.

1934
01:57:03,558 --> 01:57:05,600
It was quite fun to see them all
at the airport...

1935
01:57:05,768 --> 01:57:08,645
...together as one big group.
So, yeah, it's a reunion of the family.

1936
01:57:08,813 --> 01:57:11,857
They came back and we've just been doing
what's called a press junket.

1937
01:57:12,024 --> 01:57:14,734
That's where they do interviews,
one-on-ones with the talent.

1938
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:18,488
It's interview after interview after interview
with different networks and stations.

1939
01:57:18,656 --> 01:57:20,115
So it was a long day for them.

1940
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:26,163
Cinemax.

1941
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:29,875
Hi. Wow.

1942
01:57:30,042 --> 01:57:31,877
Hello, all precious persons.

1943
01:57:33,796 --> 01:57:35,672
-It's just another day at the office.
-Okay.

1944
01:57:41,596 --> 01:57:45,640
It is 5 p.m. on the 27th of November.

1945
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:49,144
We are hours away from starting
the road closures on Courtenay Place.

1946
01:57:51,355 --> 01:57:54,065
And we're just getting ready
for a long night of installation...

1947
01:57:54,275 --> 01:57:56,610
...of red carpet, barriers, big-screen TVs...

1948
01:57:56,819 --> 01:57:59,446
...signage, placards, banners, flags.

1949
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:02,908
You name it, it's all gotta go in overnight,
ready for the morning.

1950
01:58:03,117 --> 01:58:05,785
So once again, it's obviously
a big red carpet down Courtenay Place.

1951
01:58:07,955 --> 01:58:09,873
We've had a few movie premieres
before this.

1952
01:58:10,041 --> 01:58:12,417
One that brings back all the memories
is in 2003...

1953
01:58:12,627 --> 01:58:16,046
...when we did The Return of the Ring
for the Lord of The Rings trilogy.

1954
01:58:16,214 --> 01:58:21,468
We got a Guinness World Record for the longest
red carpet at a film premiere, at 422 meters.

1955
01:58:21,677 --> 01:58:23,428
So my aim is to try and break it again.

1956
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:26,181
So the guests will be going
several times around a block...

1957
01:58:26,349 --> 01:58:30,268
...just for the hell of it, just so l can get my
Guinness World Record for this movie as well.

1958
01:58:30,436 --> 01:58:32,604
We wanna see a huge turnout,
which is gonna be amazing.

1959
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:36,525
Wellingtonians, residents,
the film industry and filmmakers.

1960
01:58:36,692 --> 01:58:40,570
But also people coming in from all around
the country, and in fact, all around the world.

1961
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,489
We come from, um, Germany.

1962
01:58:42,698 --> 01:58:45,951
We are from Melbourne, Australia.

1963
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:50,539
I arrived down here about 9:30.
I plan to sleep here on the concrete.

1964
01:58:50,706 --> 01:58:54,459
We have our Fellowship cloaks
to keep us impervious from weather.

1965
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:15,355
JACKSON:
Here we are. The day of the premiere.

1966
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:17,732
We were driving in here
at about 9:00 in the morning...

1967
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:19,985
...and there were so many people
on the red carpet.

1968
01:59:20,152 --> 01:59:22,612
And this is, you know,
eight hours ahead of time.

1969
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:25,782
And a lot of those people
had been camping there overnight.

1970
01:59:25,992 --> 01:59:29,786
It's pretty humbling really, to think that....

1971
01:59:29,954 --> 01:59:33,290
On one level l think we're making a movie.
We're making a piece of entertainment.

1972
01:59:33,457 --> 01:59:38,587
But on the other hand, there is this show
of support for what we're doing.

1973
01:59:38,754 --> 01:59:40,922
And we're very, very grateful for that.

1974
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:43,174
Hello. Yeah.

1975
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:45,051
Hello. Hello.

1976
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:49,431
Oh, um.... l think we've been steered
in the wrong direction.

1977
02:00:00,484 --> 02:00:04,487
Well, this is the smallest
press conference l've ever attended.

1978
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:09,701
There's a couple big sequences
that you might want to, you know....

1979
02:00:09,869 --> 02:00:13,455
Look, l did that when
Barry's goiter was flopping around.

1980
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:18,710
Perhaps that is one of
the most horrifying images.

1981
02:00:18,878 --> 02:00:20,295
But, um, heh, heh....

1982
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:24,341
TAKACS: Hey. Coming to you
from the premiere event team office.

1983
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:25,967
The conference has finished.

1984
02:00:26,135 --> 02:00:29,179
We're four hours away
from the red carpet.

1985
02:00:29,347 --> 02:00:31,097
You shall not....

1986
02:00:31,265 --> 02:00:33,892
TAKACS: One of the things
that's been awesome is that in the buildup...

1987
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:37,729
...we've had the Lord of The Rings trilogy
playing right out of our balcony. lt's been great.

1988
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:44,486
We have brought out elements. There's gonna
be segments of sets, props along the carpet.

1989
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:48,823
Every now and again along the way,
the actors will have photo opportunities...

1990
02:00:48,991 --> 02:00:50,825
...with some of the set dressing...

1991
02:00:50,993 --> 02:00:54,079
...some of the typical
hobbit-ish environment...

1992
02:00:54,246 --> 02:00:58,333
...on the way to the cinema,
which is another 300 meters up the road.

1993
02:00:58,542 --> 02:01:00,669
WlLSON: We'll have some extras
dressed up as Hobbits.

1994
02:01:00,878 --> 02:01:04,130
Lots of ears, and wigs,
and costumes, and hairy feet.

1995
02:01:04,674 --> 02:01:05,924
Hello.

1996
02:01:07,843 --> 02:01:09,135
No problems with the crowd.

1997
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,930
MAN: Have you had any streakers?
-Oh. Not yet.

1998
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:14,432
-Not yet. l'll be looking out for that.
-Ha, ha, ha.

1999
02:01:16,477 --> 02:01:19,688
Well, it's here, it's time.
I believe it's almost 4:30.

2000
02:01:19,897 --> 02:01:23,066
Neil Finn's on the stage.
VIP cars are about to arrive.

2001
02:01:23,275 --> 02:01:26,152
So basically the red carpet is beginning.
The media pits are full...

2002
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:27,696
...barriers are full of the crowd.

2003
02:01:27,905 --> 02:01:32,200
I can probably from here, must see about
1 0,000 Gandalf hats on everyone's heads.

2004
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:35,912
We're waiting for the big man to arrive,
and the rest of the talent. lt's nearly time.

2005
02:01:36,122 --> 02:01:38,832
ANNOUNCER & CROWD:
Three, two, one!

2006
02:01:43,254 --> 02:01:46,673
This is for Peter, Fran and Philippa.
Thank you.

2007
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:54,848
Far over the misty mountains rise

2008
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:58,852
Leave us standing

2009
02:01:59,019 --> 02:02:00,854
Hello. Hello.

2010
02:02:01,772 --> 02:02:04,649
Hey, everybody, how are you? You all right?

2011
02:02:04,859 --> 02:02:06,818
That was before

2012
02:02:07,862 --> 02:02:11,448
We see once more

2013
02:02:12,074 --> 02:02:13,450
Is our kingdom

2014
02:02:13,617 --> 02:02:15,326
JACKSON:
How long have you guys been standing here?

2015
02:02:15,494 --> 02:02:16,703
Forever.

2016
02:02:16,871 --> 02:02:19,038
-I hope you've got sunscreen on.
-We do. A little bit.

2017
02:02:19,206 --> 02:02:20,790
JACKSON:
A little bit.

2018
02:02:22,418 --> 02:02:24,711
-I like your ears.
-Thank you very much for coming.

2019
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:29,924
It is insane.

2020
02:02:30,092 --> 02:02:34,804
There's fans left and right, and everywhere you
can look. And it's amazing. So much support.

2021
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:38,892
-I love it.
MAN: Can I ask where your shoes came from?

2022
02:02:39,101 --> 02:02:43,188
JACKSON: From the floor in the hallway,
just underneath where the raincoats hang.

2023
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:46,232
I hope l'm still in it.

2024
02:02:47,693 --> 02:02:48,818
MAN:
Here it comes.

2025
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,530
Who's that?

2026
02:02:55,743 --> 02:02:57,535
I couldn't be more overjoyed for Wellington.

2027
02:02:57,703 --> 02:03:00,872
Perfect weather, amazing people,
amazing culture.

2028
02:03:01,081 --> 02:03:05,210
It's nice to be back, isn't it?

2029
02:03:05,711 --> 02:03:07,420
Yes.

2030
02:03:09,131 --> 02:03:10,965
I have to stop signing things.

2031
02:03:11,133 --> 02:03:12,759
Well, you can sign it if you want.

2032
02:03:12,968 --> 02:03:15,386
I'm gonna sign you as well in a minute.

2033
02:03:20,142 --> 02:03:22,143
That's representing.

2034
02:03:22,645 --> 02:03:24,187
We've done it.

2035
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:29,526
-Couldn't have done it without you.
-Couldn't have without you.

2036
02:03:30,945 --> 02:03:35,657
There's a guy running down here right now
with a USB stick to stick it in the projector.

2037
02:03:35,825 --> 02:03:37,158
Last-minute changes.

2038
02:03:37,368 --> 02:03:40,954
We're walking really slow on the carpet
to try and buy him some time.

2039
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:51,756
JACKSON: Okay, should we bring up
some of our actors?

2040
02:03:51,966 --> 02:03:54,092
CROWD:
Yeah!

2041
02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:05,144
JACKSON: l just want to thank you
very much for coming.

2042
02:04:05,312 --> 02:04:07,981
Honestly, it means such a lot
to all of us here.

2043
02:04:08,148 --> 02:04:12,569
The last thing l have to do
is there's one member of our cast...

2044
02:04:12,736 --> 02:04:15,071
...a very distinguished member
who couldn't be here tonight.

2045
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:17,782
But he did want to send
a greeting to everybody.

2046
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:21,744
So, uh, let me welcome Sir lan McKellen.

2047
02:04:22,288 --> 02:04:24,622
McKELLEN:
Hello, this is lan mcKellen in London.

2048
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:26,875
Look, is this 3D?

2049
02:04:27,042 --> 02:04:29,544
Is this 48 frames per second?

2050
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:32,463
Anyway, my love to everybody. Peter...

2051
02:04:33,257 --> 02:04:36,259
...Fran, Philippa, all the cast.

2052
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,094
And my favorite Dwarf.

2053
02:04:38,262 --> 02:04:39,304
You know who you are.

2054
02:04:40,306 --> 02:04:41,347
And the crew.

2055
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:44,684
I'll see you soon. Lots of love. Bye-bye.

2056
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:52,358
JACKSON: That was an amazing experience.
God, my adrenaline is still running.

2057
02:04:52,526 --> 02:04:53,776
Mind the step. Mind the step.

2058
02:04:53,944 --> 02:04:57,488
JACKSON: The first time l've seen the film
with an audience. I'm really looking forward...

2059
02:04:57,656 --> 02:04:59,490
...to seeing how they respond.

2060
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,576
Katie has been my companion
on the red carpet.

2061
02:05:01,744 --> 02:05:03,745
Thank heavens
I had somebody to share it with.

2062
02:05:03,913 --> 02:05:06,122
This is the little girl
that was a tiny Hobbit baby...

2063
02:05:06,290 --> 02:05:08,249
-...in The Fellowshig of the Ring.
KATlE: Ha, ha.

2064
02:05:08,417 --> 02:05:11,377
JACKSON: ln fact, you were listening
to the story of The Hobbit.

2065
02:05:11,587 --> 02:05:15,381
So there l was,
at the mercy of three monstrous Trolls.

2066
02:05:16,967 --> 02:05:18,343
So we're gonna say goodbye now.

2067
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:21,804
And have a fantastic holiday,
a wonderful Christmas, everyone.

2068
02:05:21,972 --> 02:05:25,433
And thanks for your support throughout
the making of the first hobbit movie...

2069
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:27,352
...The Unexpected Journey.
And you know what?

2070
02:05:27,519 --> 02:05:31,606
We'll be back with our first blog
for the second hobbit movie.

2071
02:05:31,774 --> 02:05:34,609
There's so much work ahead of us.
But we will be back in the new year.

2072
02:05:34,777 --> 02:05:37,236
And we will share the experiences
of the second movie...

2073
02:05:37,404 --> 02:05:38,947
...all the way through next year.

2074
02:05:39,114 --> 02:05:41,199
-So I look forward to talking to you again.
-Bye.

2075
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:42,825
-Bye.
-Ha, ha, ha.

2076
02:05:43,744 --> 02:05:45,286
Yeah! Thank you so much.

2077
02:05:45,454 --> 02:05:47,330
Thank you!

2078
02:06:11,563 --> 02:06:13,439
Michael, can you just leave for a second?

2079
02:06:13,691 --> 02:06:15,984
WOMAN: Good morning.
-Oh, my God.

2080
02:06:16,151 --> 02:06:18,069
It's too early for this.

2081
02:06:18,278 --> 02:06:19,988
I'm just gonna turn the camera around.

2082
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:22,782
-Come on.
-Oh.

2083
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:25,451
Will you stop filming?

2084
02:06:25,619 --> 02:06:29,956
It's a matter of running around trying
to not miss things just as they happen.

2085
02:06:30,124 --> 02:06:32,083
What are you filming now, wind?

2086
02:06:33,627 --> 02:06:35,169
No profiles.

2087
02:06:36,588 --> 02:06:38,256
I said, no profiles.

2088
02:06:38,507 --> 02:06:40,299
Are you filming? I'm gonna delete this.

2089
02:06:40,718 --> 02:06:44,679
Let's just say once this footage
is in the system, is in the system.

2090
02:06:45,305 --> 02:06:46,597
What are you doing?

2091
02:06:47,933 --> 02:06:49,642
I'm running away to join the Orcs.

2092
02:06:49,935 --> 02:06:53,688
My line for today will be,
"l'll take on the dragon."

2093
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:56,858
WOMAN: Do you actually have the line?
-No. No, l don't have a line.

2094
02:06:57,026 --> 02:07:00,028
-Say "see you later" to all The Hobbit crew.
-Bye!
