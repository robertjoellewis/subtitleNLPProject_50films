War is coming.

659
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:35,526
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

660
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:38,112
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

661
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:41,991
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

662
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:45,244
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

663
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:50,124
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

664
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:53,085
But for all their cunning...

665
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:55,838
...we have one advantage.

666
01:01:57,965 --> 01:02:00,551
The Ring remains hidden.

667
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:03,554
And that we should seek to destroy it...

668
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:06,682
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

669
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,603
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

670
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,271
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

671
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:16,525
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

672
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,320
We must trust now in Frodo.

673
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,322
Everything depends upon speed...

674

...and the secrecy of his quest.

675
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:29,789
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

676
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:33,417
Frodo must finish this task alone.

[HOBBITS LAUGHING]

2105
03:28:29,506 --> 03:28:30,799
This is the old sewer.

2106
03:28:30,966 --> 03:28:34,094
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

2107
03:28:34,261 --> 03:28:36,013
You'll find cover in the woods there.

2108
03:28:37,055 --> 03:28:39,558
Captain Faramir...

2109
03:28:40,184 --> 03:28:42,019
...you have shown your quality, sir.

2110
03:28:44,521 --> 03:28:45,814
The very highest.

2111
03:28:46,315 --> 03:28:48,942
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

2112
03:28:49,109 --> 03:28:52,070
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

2113
03:28:53,238 --> 03:28:55,240
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

2114
03:28:55,824 --> 03:28:57,409
Gollum says there's a path...

2115
03:28:57,576 --> 03:29:01,497
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

2116
03:29:01,955 --> 03:29:03,707
Cirith Ungol?

2117
03:29:07,252 --> 03:29:09,796
- Is that its name?
- No.

2118
03:29:09,963 --> 03:29:11,632
No!

2119
03:29:12,466 --> 03:29:15,469
- Yes.
- Frodo...

2120
03:29:15,844 --> 03:29:19,389
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

2121
03:29:20,265 --> 03:29:22,809
- You cannot go that way.
SMÉAGOL: It is the only way.

2122
03:29:23,143 --> 03:29:29,441
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

2123
03:29:30,943 --> 03:29:32,736
I must.

2124
03:29:36,281 --> 03:29:39,868
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

2125
03:29:40,035 --> 03:29:42,079
Thank you.

2126
03:29:53,882 --> 03:29:58,011
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

2127
03:30:10,482 --> 03:30:12,025
SAM:
Come on, keep up.

2128
03:30:15,487 --> 03:30:18,282
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

2129
03:30:18,907 --> 03:30:20,742
You know that, don't you?

2130
03:30:21,535 --> 03:30:23,120
He was trying to save you, see?

2131
03:30:23,620 --> 03:30:25,163
Save me?

2132
03:30:25,497 --> 03:30:27,666
So there's no hard feelings.

2133
03:30:27,833 --> 03:30:32,963
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

2134
03:30:33,130 --> 03:30:35,757
Gollum, Gollum.

2135
03:30:36,800 --> 03:30:38,552
Nice master.

2136
03:30:39,636 --> 03:30:42,472
- Nice Hobbits.
SAM: Very decent of you.

2137
03:30:42,639 --> 03:30:44,933
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

2138
03:30:50,439 --> 03:30:55,652
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

2140
03:31:02,784 --> 03:31:05,787
GANDALF:
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

2141
03:31:06,455 --> 03:31:10,000
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

2142
03:31:15,130 --> 03:31:18,550
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

2143
03:31:19,551 --> 03:31:22,763
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

2144
03:31:26,058 --> 03:31:29,478
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

2145
03:31:29,645 --> 03:31:31,021
What?

2146
03:31:31,188 --> 03:31:35,150
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

2147
03:31:35,317 --> 03:31:38,570
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

2148
03:31:38,737 --> 03:31:41,698
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

2149
03:31:41,865 --> 03:31:43,533
"Yes, my boy.

2150
03:31:43,700 --> 03:31:47,496
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

2151
03:31:47,663 --> 03:31:50,207
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

2152
03:31:50,374 --> 03:31:52,250
"Samwise the Brave."

2153
03:31:52,417 --> 03:31:55,170
I want to hear more about Sam.

2154
03:31:59,466 --> 03:32:02,469
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

2155
03:32:03,804 --> 03:32:07,849
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

2156
03:32:08,934 --> 03:32:10,310
So was I.

2157
03:32:19,194 --> 03:32:21,905
"Samwise the Brave."

2158
03:32:26,159 --> 03:32:27,494
FRODO:
Sméagol?

2159
03:32:27,661 --> 03:32:30,580
SAM: We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

2160
03:32:30,747 --> 03:32:32,666
Master.

2161
03:32:32,833 --> 03:32:35,794
Master looks after us.

2162
03:32:36,586 --> 03:32:39,381
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2163
03:32:39,548 --> 03:32:42,008
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.

2164
03:32:42,175 --> 03:32:44,344
SMÉAGOL:
Don't ask Sméagol.

2165
03:32:44,511 --> 03:32:47,723
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2166
03:32:47,889 --> 03:32:50,726
Master betrayed us.

2167
03:32:50,892 --> 03:32:53,979
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2168
03:32:54,146 --> 03:32:58,066
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2169
03:32:58,233 --> 03:33:00,986
Kill him! Kill him!

2170
03:33:01,153 --> 03:33:02,654
Kill them both!

2171
03:33:02,821 --> 03:33:06,450
And then we take the precious...

2172
03:33:06,616 --> 03:33:10,162
...and we be the master!

2173
03:33:10,829 --> 03:33:13,498
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2174
03:33:13,665 --> 03:33:16,334
Eyes always watching.

2175
03:33:16,501 --> 03:33:20,046
Then we stabs them out.

2176
03:33:20,213 --> 03:33:24,718
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2177
03:33:24,885 --> 03:33:28,346
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2178
03:33:28,513 --> 03:33:31,224
Kill them both.

2179
03:33:31,391 --> 03:33:33,894
Yes. No! No!

2180
03:33:34,060 --> 03:33:37,773
It's too risky. It's too risky.

SAM:
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2182
03:33:41,234 --> 03:33:43,862
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
FRODO: Sméagol?

2183
03:33:44,029 --> 03:33:49,409
We could let her do it.

2184
03:33:50,368 --> 03:33:54,539
Yes. She could do it.

2185
03:33:54,706 --> 03:33:59,252
Yes, precious, she could.

2186
03:33:59,419 --> 03:34:05,467
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2187
03:34:06,384 --> 03:34:08,136
Once they're dead.

03:34:08,303 --> 03:34:10,305
Shh.

2189
03:34:13,642 --> 03:34:17,354
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2190
03:34:17,521 --> 03:34:19,564
Sméagol will show you the way.

2191
03:34:19,731 --> 03:34:21,983
Follow me.
