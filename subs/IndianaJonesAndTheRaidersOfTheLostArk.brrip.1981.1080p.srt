<font face="Comic Sans MS">The poison is still fresh,
3 days.</font>

3
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're following us.</font>

4
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.</font>

5
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:54,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it.</font>

6
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where Forrestal
cashed in.</font>

00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A friend of yours?
- A competitor.</font>

00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was good.</font>

9
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was very, very good.</font>

10
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:07,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I senor, nobody's
come out of there alive</font>

11
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please...</font>

12
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Senor.</font>

13
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

14
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay out of the light.</font>

15
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:43,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forrestal.</font>

16
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.</font>

17
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what scares me.</font>

18
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here.</font>

19
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I
If you insist, senor.</font>

20
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the whip.</font>

21
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw me the idol.</font>

22
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No time to argue.</font>

23
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.</font>

24
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the whip!</font>

Adios, senor.</font>

26
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adios, Satipo.</font>

27
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones.</font>

28
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again we see there is nothing
you can possess</font>

29
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which I cannot take away.</font>

30
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you thought I had given up.</font>

31
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You chose the wrong friends.
This time, it will cost you.</font>

32
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:33,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too bad the Hovitos
don't know you the way I do, Belloq.</font>

33
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, too bad.</font>

34
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.</font>

35
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jock! Start the engines!</font>

36
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it up!</font>

37
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jock, the engines!</font>

38
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start the engines, Jock!</font>

39
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!</font>

40
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!</font>

41
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate snakes, Jock!</font>

42
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate 'em!</font>

43
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?</font>

44
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Neo," meaning "new"</font>

45
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:03,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and "Lithic"... "L-T-H"...</font>

46
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meaning "stone."</font>

47
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's get back to this site:</font>

48
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.</font>

49
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contains a central passage
and 3 chambers, or cysts...</font>

50
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:23,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...don't confuse that
with robbing, in which case we mean</font>

51
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the removal of the contents
of the barrow.</font>

52
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This site also demonstrates...</font>

53
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...one of the great dangers
of archeology,</font>

54
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place.</font>

55
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm talking about folklore.</font>

56
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this case,
local tradition held</font>

57
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that there was a golden coffin
buried at the site,</font>

58
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow</font>

59
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the generally poor condition
of the find.</font>

60
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, chamber 3
was undisturbed,</font>

61
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods</font>

62
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that were found in another, uh...</font>

63
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the area, give us a r...</font>

64
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

65
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,</font>

66
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">uh, find as we have.</font>

67
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:08,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

68
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any questions, then?</font>

69
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.</font>

70
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, don't forget...</font>

71
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:19,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michaelson, chapters 4
and 5 for next time.</font>

72
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.</font>

73
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:33,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had it, Marcus.</font>

74
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had it in my hand.</font>

75
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened?
- Guess.</font>

76
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Belloq?
- You want to hear about it?</font>

77
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at all.</font>

78
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure everything you do
for the museum</font>

79
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">conforms to the International Treaty
for the Protection of Antiquities.</font>

80
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful, Marcus.</font>

81
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get it.
I got it all figured out.</font>

82
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.</font>

83
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need $2,000. Look...</font>

84
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:55,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me, old boy.</font>

85
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought some people
to see you.</font>

86
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

87
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got these pieces.</font>

88
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:00,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're good pieces, Marcus.</font>

89
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look.
- Indiana...</font>

90
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.</font>

91
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, they are nice.
- They're worth at least</font>

92
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.</font>

93
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:10,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the people
I brought are important,</font>

94
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:11,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and they're waiting.
- What people?</font>

95
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Army Intelligence.</font>

96
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They knew you were coming
before I did.</font>

97
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seem to know everything.</font>

98
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They wouldn't tell me
what they want.</font>

99
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what do I want
to see them for?</font>

100
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I, in trouble?</font>

101
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Dr. Jones,</font>

102
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've heard a great deal
about you.</font>

103
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you?</font>

104
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, professor of archeology,</font>

105
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">expert on the occult,</font>

106
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, uh, how does one say it?</font>

107
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obtainer of rare antiquities.</font>

108
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one way of saying it.</font>

109
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.</font>

110
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

111
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:44,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you're a man
of many talents.</font>

112
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood</font>

113
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the University of Chicago.</font>

114
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did.</font>

115
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?</font>

116
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... well, just rumors, really.</font>

117
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere in Asia, I think.</font>

118
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't really spoken
to him for 10 years.</font>

119
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were friends, but, uh...</font>

120
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.</font>

121
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

122
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand</font>

123
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?</font>

124
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:12,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>

125
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

126
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:18,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections</font>

127
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">intercepted a...
a German communique</font>

128
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.</font>

129
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last 2 years,</font>

130
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Nazis have had teams
of archeologists</font>

131
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:32,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">running around the world looking
for all kinds of religious artifacts.</font>

132
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hitler's a nut on the subject.</font>

133
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's crazy.</font>

134
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's obsessed with the occult.</font>

135
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, right now, apparently,</font>

136
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's some kind
of German archeological dig</font>

137
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">going on in the desert

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we've got some
information here,</font>

139
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.</font>

144
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?</font>

145
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:06,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it...</font>

146
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.</font>

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The chest the Hebrews used</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">to carry around
the Ten Commandments.</font>

151
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean,
"commandments"?</font>

152
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talking
about the Ten Commandments?</font>

153
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.</font>

154
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The original stone tablets</font>

155
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,</font>

156
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you believe
in that sort of thing.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any of you guys

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, I...
- Oh, look.</font>

159
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hebrews took
the broken pieces</font>

160
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,</font>

161
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.</font>

162
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Jerusalem.</font>

163
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where it stayed for many years.</font>

164
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.</font>

165
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

166
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, nobody knows
where or when.</font>

167
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, an Egyptian pharaoh...</font>

168
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shishak.
- Yes.</font>

169
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,</font>

170
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis</font>

171
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hidden it
in a secret chamber</font>

172
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">called the Well of Souls.</font>

173
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secret chamber?</font>

174
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, about a year</font>

175
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,</font>

176
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert</font>

177
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:10,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.</font>

178
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wiped clean by the wrath of God.</font>

179
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

180
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, we've come
to the right men.</font>

181
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you seem to know, uh,</font>

182
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all about this Tanis, then.</font>

183
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, not really.</font>

184
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ravenwood is the real expert.</font>

185
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.</font>

186
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Collected some of its relics.</font>

187
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was his obsession, really.</font>

188
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he never found the city.</font>

189
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:37,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.</font>

190
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An American being mentioned
so prominently</font>

191
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a secret Nazi cable.</font>

192
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.</font>

193
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?</font>

194
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking</font>

195
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra</font>

196
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they think Abner's got it.</font>

197
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?</font>

198
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the staff
is just a stick...</font>

199
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, about this big,</font>

200
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nobody really knows
for sure how high...</font>

201
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped</font>

202
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with an elaborate headpiece...</font>

203
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:08,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.</font>

204
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what you did was</font>

205
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...</font>

206
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A map room with a miniature</font>

207
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the city all laid out
on the floor,</font>

208
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if you put the staff
in a certain place,</font>

209
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here</font>

210
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...</font>

211
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.</font>

212
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?</font>

213
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.</font>

214
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does this Ark look like?</font>

215
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

216
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a picture of it
right here.</font>

217
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

218
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good God.</font>

219
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.</font>

220
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

221
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?</font>

222
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lightning...</font>

223
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">fire...</font>

224
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">power of God or something.</font>

225
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm beginning to understand</font>

226
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hitler's interest in this.</font>

227
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>

228
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,</font>

229
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and laying waste
to entire regions.</font>

230
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:21,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An army which carries
the Ark before it...</font>

231
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is invincible.</font>

232
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did it, didn't you?</font>

233
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want you to go for it.</font>

234
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Marcus!</font>

235
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do</font>

236
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.</font>

237
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the museum?</font>

238
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?</font>

239
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>

240
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

241
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ark of the Covenant.</font>

242
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing else has come close.</font>

243
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing represents everything</font>

244
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we got into archeology
for in the first place.</font>

245
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm!</font>

246
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, 5 years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.</font>

247
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really rather envious.</font>

248
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to locate Abner.</font>

249
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I know where to start.</font>

250
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suppose she'll
still be with him?</font>

251
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Possibly, but...</font>

252
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion's the least
of your worries right now,</font>

253
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">believe me, Indy.</font>

254
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

255
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,</font>

256
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:46,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.</font>

257
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:50,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not something to be taken
lightly.</font>

258
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one knows its secrets.</font>

259
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.</font>

260
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Marcus.</font>

261
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you trying to do,
scare me?</font>

262
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sound like my mother.</font>

263
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've known each other
for a long time.</font>

264
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:07,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe in magic,
a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.</font>

265
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going after a find</font>

266
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of incredible
historical significance.</font>

267
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're talking
about the bogeyman.</font>

268
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.</font>

269
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.</font>

270
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

271
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh... shh...</font>

272
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh...</font>

273
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give him space!
Give him space!</font>

274
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, Regan!</font>

275
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh! Shh!</font>

276
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh! Shh! Shh!</font>

277
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Marion.</font>

278
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana Jones.</font>

279
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always knew, someday,</font>

280
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd come walking back
through my door.</font>

281
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never doubted that.</font>

282
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something made it inevitable.</font>

283
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?</font>

284
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need one of the pieces
your father collected.</font>

285
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:59,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned to hate you
in the last 10 years.</font>

286
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never meant to hurt you.</font>

287
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a child.</font>

288
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was in love.</font>

289
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was wrong and you knew it!</font>

290
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew what you were doing.</font>

291
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I do!
This is my place.</font>

292
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

293
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did what I did.</font>

294
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to be happy
about it,</font>

295
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but maybe we could help
each other out now.</font>

296
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need one of the pieces
your father collected.</font>

297
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bronze piece, about this size,</font>

298
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.</font>

299
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the one I mean?</font>

300
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

301
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it.</font>

302
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:33,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Abner?</font>

303
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abner's dead.</font>

304
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion, I'm sorry.</font>

305
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?</font>

306
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:48,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.</font>

307
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, say it again, anyway.</font>

308
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:51,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

309
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, everybody's sorry.</font>

310
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth</font>

311
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">looking
for his little bits of junk.</font>

312
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.</font>

313
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:03,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody's sorry for something.</font>

314
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.</font>

315
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You going to give it to me?</font>

316
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

317
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know where it is.</font>

318
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe you could find it.</font>

319
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3,000 bucks.</font>

320
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:19,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.</font>

321
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get you another two
when we get to the States.</font>

322
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's important, Marion.</font>

323
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>

324
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the piece I mean?</font>

325
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know where it is?</font>

326
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:35,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back tomorrow.</font>

327
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:38,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

328
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I said so, that's why.</font>

329
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:49,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha!</font>

330
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.</font>

331
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, Fraulein.</font>

332
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bar's closed.</font>

333
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:07,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We... We are...</font>

334
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not thirsty.</font>

335
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

336
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.</font>

337
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely he told you
there would be</font>

338
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">other interested parties.</font>

339
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must've slipped his mind.</font>

340
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:24,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man is... nefarious.</font>

341
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:28,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.</font>

342
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, are you willing
to offer more?</font>

343
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:34,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, almost certainly.</font>

344
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you still have it?</font>

345
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

346
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I know where it is.</font>

347
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?</font>

348
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:54,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your fire is dying here.</font>

349
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?</font>

350
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Herr Mac...</font>

351
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,</font>

352
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.</font>

353
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fraulein Ravenwood,</font>

354
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:14,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let me show you
what I am used to.</font>

355
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your hands off me!</font>

356
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your lousy hands off!</font>

357
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

358
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I... I can be reasonable.</font>

359
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That time is passed.</font>

360
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need that.</font>

361
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:39,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait...</font>

362
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you everything.</font>

363
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I know you will.</font>

364
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:54,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her go.</font>

365
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whiskey.</font>

366
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:20,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot them.</font>

367
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot them both.</font>

368
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My medallion!</font>

369
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten</font>

370
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how to show a lady a good time!</font>

371
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you're something!</font>

372
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'll tell you what.</font>

373
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until I get back my $5,000,</font>

374
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're going to get more
than you bargained for.</font>

375
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your goddamn partner!</font>

376
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cairo, city of the living.</font>

377
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A paradise on earth.</font>

378
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:25,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silence!</font>

379
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you forget yourselves?</font>

380
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

381
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did this animal come from?</font>

382
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh... oh, no.</font>

383
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cute.</font>

384
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What an adorable creature.</font>

385
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then it shall be welcome
in our house.</font>

386
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.</font>

387
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.</font>

388
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the best digger in Egypt.</font>

389
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:04,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.</font>

390
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.</font>

391
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The excavation is enormous.</font>

392
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:14,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.</font>

393
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.</font>

394
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did they find the map room?</font>

395
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:19,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three days ago.</font>

396
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have not one brain
among them.</font>

397
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except one.</font>

398
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is very clever.
He's a French archeologist.</font>

399
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's his name?</font>

400
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:31,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They call him "Bellosh."</font>

401
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Belloq. Belloq.</font>

402
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Germans have
a great advantage over us.</font>

403
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.</font>

404
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:51,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they're not
going to find it without this.</font>

405
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who can tell us
about these markings?</font>

406
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps a man I know
can help us.</font>

407
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy...</font>

408
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there is something
that troubles me.</font>

409
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

410
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ark.</font>

411
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it is there, at Tanis,</font>

412
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it is something that
man was not meant to disturb.</font>

413
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Death has always surrounded it.</font>

414
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not of this earth.</font>

415
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we need the monkey, huh?</font>

416
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm surprised at you, Jones,</font>

417
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">talking that way about our baby.</font>

418
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got your looks, too.</font>

419
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your brains.</font>

420
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oops!</font>

421
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I noticed that.</font>

422
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a smart little thing.
Smart.</font>

423
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:41,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

424
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where you going?</font>

425
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be all right.
Have a date.</font>

426
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:49,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>

427
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay...
- Marion.</font>

428
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this?</font>

429
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a date.</font>

430
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You eat 'em.</font>

431
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,</font>

432
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">raise 8 or 9 kids,
like your friend Sallah?</font>

433
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who says I haven't?</font>

434
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

435
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad had you figured
a long time ago.</font>

436
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said you were a bum.</font>

437
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he's being generous.</font>

438
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The most gifted bum
he ever trained.</font>

439
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, he loved you
like a son.</font>

440
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.</font>

441
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:14,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not much, just you.</font>

442
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion, get out of here!</font>

443
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Duck!</font>

444
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:18,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

445
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh! Shh!</font>

446
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:10,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion!</font>

447
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Over here, Indy!</font>

448
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the way!</font>

449
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! Move it!</font>

450
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>

451
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't do this to me!</font>

452
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an American!</font>

453
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

454
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana Jones!</font>

455
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me, Jones!</font>

456
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:18,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones!</font>

457
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:19,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion!</font>

458
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

459
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion...</font>

460
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:47,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones.</font>

461
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:15,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You looking for me?</font>

462
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Belloq.</font>

463
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.</font>

464
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:29,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ought to kill you right now.</font>

465
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:32,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a very private place
for a murder.</font>

466
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.</font>

467
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:39,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not going
to interfere in our business.</font>

468
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:42,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.</font>

469
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, sit down
before you fall down.</font>

470
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:47,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can at least behave
like civilized people.</font>

471
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.</font>

472
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How odd that it should end
this way for us,</font>

473
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:06,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after so many
stimulating encounters.</font>

474
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:08,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost regret it.</font>

475
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:09,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where shall I find
a new adversary</font>

476
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so close to my own level?</font>

477
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:13,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try the local sewer.</font>

478
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:19,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I are very much alike.</font>

479
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:22,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Archeology is our religion,</font>

480
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:26,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.</font>

481
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:30,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.</font>

482
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:33,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a shadowy
reflection of you.</font>

483
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,</font>

484
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to push you out of the light.</font>

485
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:42,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you're getting nasty.</font>

486
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:44,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it's true.</font>

487
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How nice.</font>

488
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.</font>

489
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's worthless.</font>

490
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 dollars
from a vendor in the street.</font>

491
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:53,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I take it,</font>

492
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:55,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,</font>

493
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:59,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it becomes priceless...
Like the Ark.</font>

494
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Men will kill for it.</font>

495
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Men like you and me.</font>

496
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your boss,
der Fuhrer?</font>

497
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought he was waiting
to take possession.</font>

498
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All in good time.</font>

499
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I am finished with it.</font>

500
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?</font>

501
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a transmitter.</font>

502
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a radio
for speaking to God.</font>

503
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's within my reach.</font>

504
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:31,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to talk to God?</font>

505
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go see Him together.</font>

506
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got nothing better to do.</font>

507
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:38,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Indy, come back home now!</font>

508
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:41,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Indy!</font>

509
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time, Indiana Jones,</font>

510
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:47,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it'll take more than children
to save you.</font>

511
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:50,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Indy!</font>

512
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I would
find you there.</font>

513
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better than the United
States Marines, eh?</font>

514
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:20,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion's dead.</font>

515
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, I know.
- And me! And me!</font>

516
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:24,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

517
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:26,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life goes on, Indy.</font>

518
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:28,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is the proof.</font>

519
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

520
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have much to tell you.</font>

521
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First we will take them home,</font>

522
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:37,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then I will take you
to the old man.</font>

523
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:31,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.</font>

524
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?</font>

525
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:36,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.</font>

526
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:</font>

527
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:41,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A headpiece like that one,</font>

528
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:43,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except round the edges,
which were rougher.</font>

529
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:45,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,</font>

530
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:50,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,</font>

531
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there were raised markings,
just like that one.</font>

532
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:57,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They made their calculations
in the map room?</font>

533
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This morning.</font>

534
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.</font>

535
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they came out
of the map room,</font>

536
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:06,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,</font>

537
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:08,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out away from the camp.</font>

538
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:11,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Well of the Souls, huh?</font>

539
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:14,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, come, look.
Look here... Look.</font>

540
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down.</font>

541
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, sit down.</font>

542
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

543
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:22,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a warning</font>

544
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:24,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.</font>

545
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:26,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the height
of the staff, though?</font>

546
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Belloq get it off of here?</font>

547
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. It is here.</font>

548
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This were the old way,</font>

549
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:34,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this mean 6 kadam high.</font>

550
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:35,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- About 72 inches.
- Wait!</font>

551
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:42,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"And take back one kadam</font>

552
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:46,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is."</font>

553
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.</font>

554
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you absolutely sure?</font>

555
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:05,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Belloq's staff is too long.</font>

556
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're digging
in the wrong place.</font>

557
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the monarch of the sea</font>

558
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:15,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the ruler of the...</font>

559
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad dates.</font>

560
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:45,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you not to be premature</font>

561
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in your communique to Berlin.</font>

562
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Archeology is not
an exact science.</font>

563
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does not deal
in time schedules.</font>

564
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Fuhrer is not
a patient man.</font>

565
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:59,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.</font>

566
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You led me to believe...</font>

567
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing!
I made no promises.</font>

568
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only said
it looked very favorable.</font>

569
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, with the information
in our possession,</font>

570
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my calculations were correct.</font>

571
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:11,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?</font>

572
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:15,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What time does the sun
hit the map room?</font>

573
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At about 9:00 in the morning.</font>

574
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:19,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not much time, then.</font>

575
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:21,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?</font>

576
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:24,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.</font>

577
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, come on.</font>

578
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah.</font>

579
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:37,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah!</font>

580
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're here.</font>

581
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:58,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, my friend,
what is the matter?</font>

582
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:00,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.</font>

583
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:04,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want water,
I will get you water.</font>

584
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No problem, no problem.</font>

585
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were dead.</font>

586
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:23,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have switched baskets.</font>

587
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you hurt?</font>

588
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.</font>

589
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna be back
at any minute.</font>

590
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut me loose.</font>

591
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:36,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick.</font>

592
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They keep asking about you.
What you know.</font>

593
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

594
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:46,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut me loose.</font>

595
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:47,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know where the Ark is, Marion.</font>

596
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:48,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ark's here?</font>

597
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!</font>

598
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!</font>

599
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:54,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I take you out of here now,</font>

600
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:55,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they'll start combing
the place for us.</font>

601
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!</font>

602
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:59,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Jones, are you crazy?</font>

603
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion, I hate to do this,</font>

604
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:04,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,</font>

605
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:06,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this whole thing
is going to be shot.</font>

606
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:09,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back to get you.</font>

607
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:11,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones, what's the matter?</font>

608
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

609
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:00,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knows?</font>

610
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps the Ark is still waiting</font>

611
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:05,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in some antechamber
for us to discover.</font>

612
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:08,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.</font>

613
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perhaps...
- Perhaps the girl can help us.</font>

614
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:12,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My feeling exactly.</font>

615
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was in possession
of the original piece for years.</font>

616
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:17,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She may know much,
if properly motivated.</font>

617
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:20,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.</font>

618
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:23,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.</font>

619
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:25,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is not your reputation.</font>

620
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:26,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it needn't concern you.</font>

621
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.</font>

622
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:35,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heil Hitler.</font>

623
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy! Here!</font>

624
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've hit stone!</font>

625
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:07,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clear it off.</font>

626
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:08,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, find the edges.</font>

627
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:26,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, good, good.</font>

628
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Indy? You see?</font>

629
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:30,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, bring the pry bars in.</font>

630
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:31,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a team, boys! As a team!</font>

631
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push!</font>

632
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:41,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.</font>

633
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, good, that's it.</font>

634
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:44,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your toes.</font>

635
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:53,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carefully, carefully!</font>

636
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Indy.</font>

637
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:10,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy...</font>

638
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:13,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why does the floor move?</font>

639
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your torch.</font>

640
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snakes.</font>

641
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:51,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did it have to be snakes?</font>

642
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asps.</font>

643
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very dangerous.</font>

644
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:01,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go first.</font>

645
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:23,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're trying
to escape on foot,</font>

646
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:26,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the desert is 3 weeks
in every direction,</font>

647
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:28,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so please, eat something.</font>

648
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:37,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must apologize
for their treatment of you.</font>

649
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Whose idea was it?</font>

650
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:39,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No food, no water.</font>

651
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:42,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of people
are these friends of yours?</font>

652
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:44,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At this particular time
and place, to do my work,</font>

653
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:46,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they are necessary evils.</font>

654
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not my friends.</font>

655
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, with the
right connections,</font>

656
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:52,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even in this part of the world,</font>

657
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we are not entirely uncivilized.</font>

658
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

659
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:01,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would very much like
to see you in it.</font>

660
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bet you would.</font>

661
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:11,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

662
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:21,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you got to drink
around here?</font>

663
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have much time.</font>

664
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:28,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon they will come to harm you,</font>

665
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:30,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will not be able
to stop them,</font>

666
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:33,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless you are able
to give me something</font>

667
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to placate them.</font>

668
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:39,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some, uh, piece
of information...</font>

669
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which I can use
to protect you from them.</font>

670
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:44,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've already told you
everything I know.</font>

671
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no loyalty to Jones.</font>

672
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's brought me
nothing but trouble.</font>

673
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion, you are beautiful.</font>

674
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
we need a chaperone.</font>

675
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:10,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steadily.</font>

676
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:11,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steadily. Whoa!</font>

677
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down...</font>

678
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:17,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down... Whoa.</font>

679
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:18,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carefully, carefully!</font>

680
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, Indy?</font>

681
01:03:23,426 --> 01:03:26,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!</font>

682
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:36,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa...</font>

683
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:48,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you it will be all right.</font>

684
01:04:04,717 --> 01:04:06,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh...</font>

685
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah, get down here!</font>

686
01:04:36,082 --> 01:04:37,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You pour.</font>

687
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:32,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's good.</font>

688
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:37,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoops.</font>

689
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this stuff, Rene?</font>

690
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:48,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I grew up with this.</font>

691
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:51,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my family label.</font>

692
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:24,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well... I have to be
going now, Rene.</font>

693
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like you, Rene, very much.</font>

694
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.</font>

695
01:07:37,263 --> 01:07:38,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We meet again, Freulein.</font>

696
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You Americans,
you're all the same.</font>

697
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:47,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.</font>

698
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now...</font>

699
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:25,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what shall we talk about?</font>

700
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:46,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right... take it up!</font>

701
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:48,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy!</font>

702
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:51,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're as stubborn as that girl.</font>

703
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:54,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like her too much, I think.</font>

704
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:58,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your methods of archeology
are too primitive for me.</font>

705
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:03,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would use a bulldozer
to find a... china cup.</font>

706
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel! Wake your men!</font>

707
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:12,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, the torches
are burning out.</font>

708
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, get out of here.</font>

709
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:15,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hyah!</font>

710
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sallah!
- Hello!</font>

711
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font>

712
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:41,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing</font>

713
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in such a nasty place?</font>

714
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!</font>

715
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:46,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, my friend,</font>

716
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:49,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.</font>

717
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, isn't it?</font>

718
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.</font>

719
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, once again, Jones,</font>

720
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:59,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what was briefly yours
is now mine.</font>

721
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:03,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.</font>

722
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:05,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're about to become
a permanent addition</font>

723
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:07,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to this archeological find.</font>

724
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:08,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knows?</font>

725
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:10,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.</font>

726
01:11:13,354 --> 01:11:14,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>

727
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:16,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.</font>

728
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our prize is awaited in Berlin.</font>

729
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:20,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do not wish to leave you</font>

730
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">down in that awful place
all alone.</font>

731
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slimy pig, you let me go!</font>

732
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:26,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!</font>

733
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion!</font>

734
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:32,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.</font>

735
01:11:33,374 --> 01:11:34,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't...</font>

736
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:35,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Indy!
- Don't fall!</font>

737
01:11:35,918 --> 01:11:37,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!</font>

738
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!</font>

739
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:53,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snakes!</font>

740
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:57,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!</font>

741
01:11:58,273 --> 01:11:59,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The girl was mine!</font>

742
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:00,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's of no use to us.</font>

743
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:02,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only our mission
for the Fuhrer matters.</font>

744
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:06,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder sometimes, monsieur,</font>

745
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:09,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you have that
clearly in mind.</font>

746
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:11,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was not to be, cherie.</font>

747
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:14,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bastards!
I'll get you for this!</font>

748
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana Jones...</font>

749
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:18,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">adieu.</font>

750
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:32,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

751
01:12:42,026 --> 01:12:43,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this.</font>

752
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wave it at anything
that slithers.</font>

753
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:46,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

754
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.</font>

755
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:52,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

756
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:54,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Jesus!</font>

757
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:59,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you get this?
From him?</font>

758
01:12:59,918 --> 01:13:01,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was trying to escape.</font>

759
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No thanks to you.</font>

760
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:03,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How hard were you trying?</font>

761
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:05,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, where the hell were you?</font>

762
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:06,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it, watch it.</font>

763
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:09,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- For the fire!</font>

764
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:13,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How the hell are we going
to get out of here?</font>

765
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:14,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!</font>

766
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.</font>

767
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:21,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah...</font>

768
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:23,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

769
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through that wall.</font>

770
01:13:26,028 --> 01:13:27,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.</font>

771
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:29,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean by that?</font>

772
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

773
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:46,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!</font>

774
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:12,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

775
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go!</font>

776
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:15,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get ready!</font>

777
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:19,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, the torch is going out!</font>

778
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:01,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy?</font>

779
01:15:21,977 --> 01:15:23,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion!</font>

780
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Look.</font>

781
01:16:04,895 --> 01:16:07,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're going to fly it
out of here.</font>

782
01:16:07,356 --> 01:16:08,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When that Ark gets loaded,</font>

783
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:09,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're already going
to be on the plane.</font>

784
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:18,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.</font>

785
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:19,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the Ark.</font>

786
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:21,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we are very far
from here.</font>

787
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:23,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Will do.</font>

788
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:20,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you now... Come here!</font>

789
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:21,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here!</font>

790
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:28,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

791
01:19:19,423 --> 01:19:21,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!</font>

792
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out!</font>

793
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:40,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

794
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion.</font>

795
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:44,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In here! Up here!</font>

796
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:47,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, come on!</font>

797
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:48,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull on the latch!</font>

798
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move up!
It's gonna blow up!</font>

799
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:56,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's stuck! Indy!</font>

800
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't force the lock!</font>

801
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:29,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's stuck!</font>

802
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Turn it! Turn it!
- It's stuck!</font>

803
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:32,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn it there!</font>

804
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind!
Get back! Get back!</font>

805
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:57,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.</font>

806
01:20:57,521 --> 01:20:59,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have it put on the truck.</font>

807
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:01,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll fly it out of Cairo.</font>

808
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:04,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.</font>

809
01:21:10,784 --> 01:21:12,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones.</font>

810
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy smoke, my friends,</font>

811
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!</font>

812
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:24,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, Indy, we have no time.</font>

813
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:26,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you still want the Ark,</font>

814
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:28,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.</font>

815
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truck?</font>

816
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:31,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What truck?</font>

817
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:00,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

818
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back to Cairo.</font>

819
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get us some transport
to England...</font>

820
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:16,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">boat, plane, anything.</font>

821
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:18,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.</font>

822
01:22:18,393 --> 01:22:19,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going after that truck.</font>

823
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:21,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How?
- I don't know.</font>

824
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:22,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm making this up as I go.</font>

825
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:01,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew!</font>

826
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:24,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's there!</font>

827
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:18,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiot! Idiot!</font>

828
01:30:04,317 --> 01:30:06,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything at last
has been arranged.</font>

829
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:07,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Ark?
- ls on board.</font>

830
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:09,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.</font>

831
01:30:09,655 --> 01:30:10,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or what is left of you.</font>

832
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:13,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You trust these guys?
- Yes.</font>

833
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:16,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Katanga.</font>

834
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.</font>

835
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:25,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are my family.</font>

836
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:28,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.</font>

837
01:30:28,341 --> 01:30:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My cabin is theirs.</font>

838
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:32,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Jones...</font>

839
01:30:32,929 --> 01:30:35,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard a lot about you, sir.</font>

840
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:37,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.</font>

841
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:44,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good-bye.</font>

842
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:48,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look after each other.</font>

843
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am already missing you.</font>

844
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:55,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my good friend.</font>

845
01:30:57,829 --> 01:30:59,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sallah.</font>

846
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is for Fayah...</font>

847
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:07,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is for your children...</font>

848
01:31:07,839 --> 01:31:10,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this is for you.</font>

849
01:31:14,887 --> 01:31:16,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

850
01:31:25,523 --> 01:31:30,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A British tar is a soaring soul</font>

851
01:31:30,903 --> 01:31:34,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As free as a mountain bird</font>

852
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:39,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His energetic fist
should be ready to...</font>

853
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:43,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a dictator...</font>

854
01:31:49,964 --> 01:31:51,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you go?</font>

855
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:53,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm cleaning up.</font>

856
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you get that?</font>

857
01:31:56,888 --> 01:31:57,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From him.</font>

858
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who him?</font>

859
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Katanga.</font>

860
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:01,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman</font>

861
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:04,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ever to travel
with these pirates.</font>

862
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's lovely.</font>

863
01:32:06,439 --> 01:32:07,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

864
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:08,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

865
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:09,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

866
01:32:09,817 --> 01:32:11,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

867
01:32:22,455 --> 01:32:23,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you say?</font>

868
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:32,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait... I don't need any help.</font>

869
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you do.</font>

870
01:32:37,303 --> 01:32:39,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the man
I knew 10 years ago.</font>

871
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:43,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.</font>

872
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:50,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are...</font>

873
01:32:51,484 --> 01:32:53,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, I don't need a nurse.</font>

874
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:54,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.</font>

875
01:32:54,654 --> 01:32:55,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion, leave me alone.</font>

876
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:57,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is this here?
- Go away.</font>

877
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:59,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it hurts.</font>

878
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

879
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:04,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?</font>

880
01:33:04,372 --> 01:33:06,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

881
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:13,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

882
01:33:22,223 --> 01:33:23,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't too bad.</font>

883
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:34,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

884
01:33:55,548 --> 01:33:56,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones...</font>

885
01:33:59,385 --> 01:34:00,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones?</font>

886
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:05,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We never seem to get
a break, do we?</font>

887
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:35,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

888
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:38,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.</font>

889
01:34:49,435 --> 01:34:51,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.</font>

890
01:34:51,145 --> 01:34:52,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

891
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:56,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.</font>

892
01:34:56,859 --> 01:34:58,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a place in the hold.
Come on, go, go, go.</font>

893
01:34:58,361 --> 01:34:59,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, go, my friend, go.</font>

894
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:14,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Dr. Jones?</font>

895
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:15,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the big idea?</font>

896
01:35:15,795 --> 01:35:17,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go!!</font>

897
01:35:21,467 --> 01:35:23,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you touch me.</font>

898
01:36:08,055 --> 01:36:09,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Jones?</font>

899
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:11,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no trace yet, sir.</font>

900
01:36:11,434 --> 01:36:12,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones is dead.</font>

901
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I killed him.</font>

902
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:19,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was of no use to us.</font>

903
01:36:20,443 --> 01:36:23,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.</font>

904
01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll bring a very good price.</font>

905
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:28,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm?</font>

906
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:33,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken...</font>

907
01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:34,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's your goal,
go in peace with it,</font>

908
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:35,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but leave us the girl.</font>

909
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:36,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would reduce our loss
on this trip.</font>

910
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:39,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Savage!</font>

911
01:36:39,879 --> 01:36:42,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not in the position
to ask for anything.</font>

912
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:44,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will take what we wish.</font>

913
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then decide whether or not</font>

914
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:48,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to blow your ship
from the water.</font>

915
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:52,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The girl goes with me.</font>

916
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:55,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be part
of my compensation.</font>

917
01:36:55,186 --> 01:36:58,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure your Fuhrer
would approve.</font>

918
01:36:58,272 --> 01:36:59,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she fails to please me,</font>

919
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:01,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you may do with her as you wish.</font>

920
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:05,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will waste
no more time with her now.</font>

921
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:06,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

922
01:37:22,338 --> 01:37:23,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.</font>

923
01:37:23,923 --> 01:37:25,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've looked everywhere.</font>

924
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:28,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got to be here somewhere.</font>

925
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:29,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look again.</font>

926
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I found him.
- Where?</font>

927
01:37:33,057 --> 01:37:34,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There.</font>

928
01:40:00,621 --> 01:40:02,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The altar has been
prepared in accordance</font>

929
01:40:02,456 --> 01:40:03,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your radio instructions,
sir.</font>

930
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:04,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

931
01:40:05,084 --> 01:40:06,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the Ark there immediately.</font>

932
01:40:09,296 --> 01:40:11,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Monsieur...</font>

933
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:14,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am uncomfortable
with the thought</font>

934
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of this... Jewish ritual.</font>

935
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:21,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure it's necessary?</font>

936
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:23,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me ask you this:</font>

937
01:40:23,686 --> 01:40:27,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,</font>

938
01:40:27,398 --> 01:40:29,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for your Fuhrer?</font>

939
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:30,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finding out, only then,</font>

940
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:33,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?</font>

941
01:40:33,821 --> 01:40:34,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knowing, only then,</font>

942
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:36,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whether you have accomplished
your mission,</font>

943
01:40:37,116 --> 01:40:39,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and obtained the one true Ark?</font>

944
01:42:08,707 --> 01:42:09,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font>

945
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:13,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones.</font>

946
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:16,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jones!</font>

947
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:18,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Rene.</font>

948
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:27,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your persistence
surprises even me.</font>

949
01:42:29,228 --> 01:42:31,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.</font>

950
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:33,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones...</font>

951
01:42:36,235 --> 01:42:38,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.</font>

952
01:42:38,862 --> 01:42:41,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.</font>

953
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:42,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I want is the girl.</font>

954
01:42:48,247 --> 01:42:49,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we refuse?</font>

955
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:53,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then your Fuhrer has no prize.</font>

956
01:42:54,253 --> 01:42:55,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, stand back.</font>

957
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of you, stand back.</font>

958
01:42:56,755 --> 01:42:58,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand back.</font>

959
01:42:58,549 --> 01:43:00,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Jones.</font>

960
01:43:00,425 --> 01:43:02,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You win!</font>

961
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:04,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blow it up.</font>

962
01:43:10,185 --> 01:43:13,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, blow it up!</font>

963
01:43:13,564 --> 01:43:15,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blow it back to God.</font>

964
01:43:16,275 --> 01:43:17,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All your life has been spent</font>

965
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in pursuit
of archeological relics.</font>

966
01:43:20,445 --> 01:43:24,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.</font>

967
01:43:25,033 --> 01:43:27,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to see it open
as well as I.</font>

968
01:43:29,288 --> 01:43:31,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana...</font>

969
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:34,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we are simply passing
through history.</font>

970
01:43:35,878 --> 01:43:37,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This...</font>

971
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is history.</font>

972
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do as you will.</font>

973
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:30,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion, don't look at it.</font>

974
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut your eyes, Marion.</font>

975
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.</font>

976
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:46,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah...</font>

977
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful!</font>

978
01:47:14,554 --> 01:47:15,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy?</font>

979
01:47:15,764 --> 01:47:16,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look, Marion!</font>

980
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your eyes shut!</font>

981
01:48:36,428 --> 01:48:37,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marion.</font>

982
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:13,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you.</font>

983
01:49:13,798 --> 01:49:17,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.</font>

984
01:49:17,636 --> 01:49:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the money's fine.</font>

985
01:49:18,803 --> 01:49:20,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The situation's
totally unacceptable.</font>

986
01:49:20,555 --> 01:49:22,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, gentlemen,
I guess that just about wraps it up.</font>

987
01:49:22,974 --> 01:49:26,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the Ark?</font>

988
01:49:26,978 --> 01:49:28,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we'd settled that.</font>

989
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:31,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ark is somewhere very safe.</font>

990
01:49:31,524 --> 01:49:32,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From whom?</font>

991
01:49:32,776 --> 01:49:35,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power</font>

992
01:49:35,487 --> 01:49:37,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it has to be researched.</font>

993
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:40,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,</font>

994
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones.</font>

995
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:45,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have top men
working on it right now.</font>

996
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

997
01:49:49,793 --> 01:49:52,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Top men.</font>

998
01:49:55,298 --> 01:49:57,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what happened?</font>

999
01:49:57,676 --> 01:49:58,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't look very happy.</font>

1000
01:49:58,843 --> 01:50:01,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?</font>

1001
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:04,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't know
what they've got there.</font>

1002
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:07,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I know what I've got here.</font>

1003
01:50:08,436 --> 01:50:09,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1004
01:50:10,063 --> 01:50:11,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll buy you a drink.</font>

1005
01:50:13,024 --> 01:50:14,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know...</font>

1006
01:50:15,193 --> 01:50:16,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a drink?</font>
