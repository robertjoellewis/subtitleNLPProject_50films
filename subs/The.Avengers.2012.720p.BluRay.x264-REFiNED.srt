1
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:32,374
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

2
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,039
It is on a little world, a human world.

3
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,130
They would wield its power,

4
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:48,140
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,762
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

6
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:58,401
<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

7
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,446
<i>A world will be his.</i>

8
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,733
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:11,531
<i>And the humans,
what can they do but burn?</i>

10
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,175
<i>All personnel,</i>

11
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,598
<i>the evacuation order
has been confirmed.</i>

12
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,002
How bad is it?

13
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,294
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

14
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,971
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

15
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,973
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

16
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,388
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

17
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,555
Spontaneous event.

18
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,640
It just turned itself on?

19
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,149
Where are the energy levels now?

20
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,527
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

21
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,732
How long to get everyone out?

22
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,480
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

23
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,944
Do better.

24
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,859
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

25
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,278
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

26
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,864
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

27
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,408
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

28
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,583
I need you to make sure

29
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,377
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

30
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,588
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

31
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,498
Until such time as the world ends,

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,458
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

33
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,006
Clear out the tech below.

34
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,263
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

35
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,843
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,428
With me.

37
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,428
Talk to me, Doctor.

38
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,852
Director.

39
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,733
Is there anything we know for certain?

40
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,145
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

41
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,155
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

42
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,659
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

43
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,115
I assume you pulled the plug.

44
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,995
She's an energy source.

45
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,370
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

46
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,575
If she reaches peak level...

47
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,212
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

48
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,793
But we don't have the harness.

49
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,964
My calculations are far from complete.

50
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,302
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

51
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,928
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

52
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,681
That can be harmful.

53
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,600
Where's Agent Barton?

54
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,473
The Hawk?

55
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,975
Up in his nest, as usual.

56
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,649
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

57
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,692
<i>I gave you this detail</i>

58
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,361
<i>so you could keep
a close eye on things.</i>

59
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,984
Well, I see better from a distance.

60
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,865
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

61
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,743
Doctor, it's spiking again.

62
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,323
No one's come or gone.

63
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,159
And Selvig's clean.

64
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,494
No contacts, no IMs.

65
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,709
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

66
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,205
"At this end"?

67
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,296
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

68
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,295
Doors open from both sides.

69
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,506
Not yet.

70
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,455
Sir, please put down the spear.

71
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,829
You have heart.

72
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,149
Please don't.

73
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,909
I still need that.

74
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,821
This doesn't have to get any messier.

75
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,079
Of course it does.

76
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,040
I've come too far for anything else.

77
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,836
I am Loki, of Asgard

78
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,165
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

79
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,834
Loki,

80
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,627
brother of Thor.

81
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,966
We have no quarrel with your people.

82
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,137
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

83
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,510
Are you planning to step on us?

84
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,105
I come with glad tidings

85
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,021
of a world made free.

86
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,608
Free from what?

87
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,940
Freedom.

88
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,064
Freedom is life's great lie.

89
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,776
Once you accept that, in your heart,

90
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,082
you will know peace.

91
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,119
Yeah, you say "peace,"

92
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,208
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

93
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,874
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

94
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,462
This place is about to blow

95
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,963
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

96
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,720
He means to bury us.

97
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,051
Like the pharaohs of old.

98
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,303
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

99
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,560
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

100
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,886
Well, then.

101
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,744
I need these vehicles.

102
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,913
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

103
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,501
<i>Hill!</i>

104
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,623
Do you copy?

105
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,130
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

106
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,941
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

107
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,684
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

108
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,199
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

109
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,668
<i>Director?</i>

110
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,427
Director Fury, do you copy?

111
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,096
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

112
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,428
I have men down. Hill?

113
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,014
A lot of men still under.

114
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,929
I don't know how many survivors.

115
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,312
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

116
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,018
I want every living soul
not working rescue

117
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,099
looking for that briefcase.

118
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,275
Roger that.

119
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,813
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

120
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,698
<i>As of right now,</i>

121
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,158
we are at war.

122
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,453
What do we do?

123
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,777
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

124
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,658
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

125
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,863
Believe me

126
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,994
this is better.

127
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,875
Who are you working for?

128
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,831
Lermentov, yes?

129
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,457
Does he think

130
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,338
we have to go through him

131
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,335
to move our cargo?

132
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,387
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

133
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
Solohob

134
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,013
a bagman, a front.

135
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,645
Your outdated information betrays you.

136
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,815
The famous Black Widow

137
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,821
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

138
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,871
You really think I'm pretty?

139
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,834
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

140
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,710
to move the tanks.

141
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,300
Tell him he is out.

142
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,344
Well...

143
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,802
...you may have to write it down.

144
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,396
It's for her.

145
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,159
You listen carefully

146
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,532
<i>You're at 1-14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

147
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,038
<i>We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.</i>

148
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,992
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block</i>

149
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,169
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

150
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,924
<i>- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working.</i>

151
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,258
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

152
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,261
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

153
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,008
This moron is giving me everything.

154
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,061
I don't give everything.

155
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,889
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

156
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,973
<i>Natasha...</i>

157
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,068
Barton's been compromised.

158
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,315
Let me put you on hold.

159
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,024
Where is Barton now?

160
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,488
<i>- We don't know.
- But he's alive?</i>

161
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,529
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

162
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,998
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

163
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,334
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

164
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,667
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

165
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,689
Who are you?

166
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,315
Get out!

167
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,948
There is sickness here!

168
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,027
You're a doctor.

169
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,080
My father's not waking up!

170
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,783
He has a fever and he's moaning

171
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,038
but his eyes won't open.

172
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,118
Slow down.

173
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,662
My father...

174
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,332
Like them?

175
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,633
Please.

176
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,125
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

177
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,627
You know, for a man

178
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,999
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

179
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,253
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

180
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,337
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

181
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,756
Then what is it? Yoga?

182
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,518
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

183
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,148
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

184
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,978
Just you and me.

185
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,278
And your actress buddy?

186
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,188
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

187
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,110
I did.

188
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,365
Who are you?

189
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,442
Natasha Romanoff.

190
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,364
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

191
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,125
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

192
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,623
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

193
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,040
S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,959
How did they find me?

195
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,547
We never lost you, Doctor.

196
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,091
We've kept our distance.

197
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,888
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

198
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,090
off your scent.

199
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,721
Why?

200
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,223
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

201
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,729
But now we need you to come in.

202
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,599
What if I say no?

203
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,025
I'll persuade you.

204
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,691
And what if the other guy says no?

205
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,031
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

206
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,491
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

207
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,664
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

208
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,628
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

209
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,584
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

210
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,260
This

211
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,547
is the Tesseract.

212
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,515
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

213
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,512
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

214
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,266
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

215
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,529
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

216
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,657
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

217
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,318
If there was, that's where I'd be.

218
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,161
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

219
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,868
Not that he's told me.

220
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,250
And he tells you everything?

221
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,494
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

222
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,749
He needs me in a cage?

223
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,795
No one's going to put you in a...

224
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,713
Stop lying to me!

225
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,591
I'm sorry. That was mean.

226
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,723
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

227
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,887
Why don't we do this the easy way

228
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,350
where you don't use that

229
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,233
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

230
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,568
Okay?

231
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,896
Natasha?

232
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,618
Stand down.

233
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,121
<i>We're good here.</i>

234
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,250
"Just you and me."

235
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,247
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

236
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,882
<i>You're dealing
with forces you can't control.</i>

237
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,753
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

238
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,764
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

239
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,348
<i>You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

240
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,100
Not Asgard. Loki.

241
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,106
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

242
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,274
<i>His brother.</i>

243
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,318
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

244
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,603
but he's worlds away.

245
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,613
We can't depend on him to help, either.

246
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,690
It's up to us.

247
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,447
<i>Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

248
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,781
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

249
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,955
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

250
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,124
We need a response team.

251
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,455
<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>

252
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,461
This isn't about the Avengers.

253
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,959
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

254
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,375
<i>You're running the world's greatest
covert security network</i>

255
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,130
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race</i>

256
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,548
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

257
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,595
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

258
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,677
We need a response team.

259
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,968
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

260
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:23,231
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

261
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,974
<i>You believe?</i>

262
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,486
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

263
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,820
No, it's won by soldiers.

264
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,798
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

265
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,675
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

266
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,018
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

267
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,021
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

268
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,855
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

269
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,629
Trouble sleeping?

270
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,387
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

271
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,805
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

272
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,769
When I went under,
the world was at war.

273
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,482
I wake up, they say we won.

274
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,731
They didn't say what we lost.

275
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,700
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

276
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,736
Some, very recently.

277
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,822
Are you here with a mission, sir?

278
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,952
I am.

279
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,453
Trying to get me back in the world?

280
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,622
Trying to save it.

281
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,588
HYDRA's secret weapon.

282
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,548
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

283
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,799
when he was looking for you.

284
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,972
He thought what we think.

285
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,394
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

286
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,730
That's something
the world sorely needs.

287
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,691
Who took it from you?

288
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,319
He's called Loki.

289
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,775
He's not from around here.

290
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,699
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

291
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,026
if you're in.

292
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,661
The world has gotten even stranger

293
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,904
than you already know.

294
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,999
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

295
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,289
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

296
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,709
There's a debriefing packet

297
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,211
waiting for you back at your apartment.

298
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,344
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

299
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,845
that we ought to know now?

300
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,474
You should have left it in the ocean.

301
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,044
<i>Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.</i>

302
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,586
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

303
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,761
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

304
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,010
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

305
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,474
of self-sustaining clean energy.

306
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,810
<i>Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over</i>

307
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,182
<i>and it actually works.</i>

308
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,813
<i>I assume.</i>

309
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,014
Light her up.

310
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,854
<i>How does it look?</i>

311
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,695
Like Christmas, but with more me.

312
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,484
<i>We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.</i>

313
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,659
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

314
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,327
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

315
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,905
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

316
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,207
<i>Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?</i>

317
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,867
<i>Enjoy the moment.</i>

318
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,952
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

319
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,462
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.</i>

320
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,047
<i>I'm not in.</i>

321
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,046
I'm actually out.

322
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,896
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

323
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,524
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

324
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,316
Levels are holding steady, I think.

325
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,701
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

326
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,076
Which brings me to my next question.

327
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,242
How does it feel to be a genius?

328
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,658
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

329
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:56,375
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

330
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,916
No, all this came from that.

331
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,502
Give yourself some credit. Please.

332
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,719
Stark Tower is your baby.

333
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,006
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

334
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,632
12%?

335
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,974
An argument can be made for 15.

336
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,852
12%? My baby?

337
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,684
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

338
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,264
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

339
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,192
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

340
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,769
That was on you.

341
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,820
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

342
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,865
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

343
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,447
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

344
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,236
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

345
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,284
It's not going to be that subtle.

346
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,744
I'll tell you what.

347
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,204
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

348
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,748
On the lease.

349
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,043
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

350
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,502
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

351
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,134
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

352
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,011
<i>Mr Stark, we need to talk.</i>

353
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,673
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

354
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,966
<i>- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.</i>

355
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,098
Then leave it urgently.

356
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,808
Security breach. It's on you.

357
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,599
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

358
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,683
"Phil"?

359
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,855
I can't stay.

360
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,437
His first name is "Agent."

361
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,192
Come on in. We're celebrating.

362
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,114
Which is why he can't stay.

363
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,484
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

364
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,697
I don't like being handed things.

365
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,157
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

366
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,697
So, let's trade.

367
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,786
Thank you.

368
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,044
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

369
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,120
every other Thursday.

370
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,497
This isn't a consultation.

371
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,672
Is this about the Avengers?

372
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,171
Which I know nothing about.

373
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,883
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

374
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,297
And I didn't even qualify.

375
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,380
I didn't know that either.

376
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,722
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

377
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,927
don't play well with others.

378
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,391
That I did know.

379
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,188
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

380
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,686
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

381
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,850
Half a mo.

382
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,279
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

383
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,988
I was having 12% of a moment.

384
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,947
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

385
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,116
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

386
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,080
What is all this?

387
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,870
This is

388
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,496
this.

389
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,963
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

390
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,172
Tomorrow.

391
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,725
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

392
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,768
Well, what if I didn't?

393
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,763
- If you didn't?
- Yeah.

394
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,148
You mean when you've finished?

395
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,524
Well, then...

396
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,737
Square deal. Fly safe.

397
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,368
Work hard.

398
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,998
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

399
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,960
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

400
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,085
I want to hear

401
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,917
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

402
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,258
She moved back to Portland.

403
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,137
What? Boo!

404
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,023
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

405
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,406
So, this Dr Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

406
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,157
A lot of people were.

407
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,784
You were the world's first superhero.

408
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,450
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

409
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,781
Erskine's original formula.

410
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,083
Didn't really go his way, did it?

411
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,202
Not so much.

412
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,962
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

413
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,463
He's like a smart person.

414
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,886
I gotta say,

415
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,473
it's an honour to meet you officially.

416
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,142
I've sort of met you. I mean,

417
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,811
I watched you while you were sleeping.

418
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,144
I mean, I was present

419
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,644
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

420
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,113
You know, it's really just a huge honour

421
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,940
to have you on board this...

422
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,446
I hope I'm the man for the job.

423
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,533
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

424
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,665
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

425
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,325
I had a little design input.

426
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,744
The uniform?

427
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,496
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

428
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,835
old-fashioned?

429
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,759
With everything that's happening

430
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,507
and the things that are about
to come to light,

431
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,966
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

432
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,711
The Chitauri grow restless.

433
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,628
Let them gird themselves.

434
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,385
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

435
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,555
Battle?

436
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,803
Against the meagre might of Earth?

437
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,848
Glorious, not lengthy.

438
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,894
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

439
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,312
You question us?

440
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,902
You question him,

441
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,526
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

442
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,411
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

443
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,827
when you were cast out, defeated?

444
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,829
I was a king!

445
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,245
The rightful king of Asgard,

446
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,416
betrayed.

447
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,920
Your ambition is little

448
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,752
and born of childish need.

449
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,217
We look beyond the Earth

450
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,132
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

451
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,093
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

452
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,804
I don't threaten.

453
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,192
But until I open the doors,

454
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,026
until your force is mine to command,

455
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,573
you are but words.

456
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:02,737
You will have your war, Asgardian.

457
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,536
If you fail,

458
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:11,962
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

459
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,500
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

460
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,011
no crevice where he cannot find you.

461
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,345
You think you know pain?

462
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:29,935
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

463
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,468
Stow the captain's gear.

464
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,591
Yes, sir.

465
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,262
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

466
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,768
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

467
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,927
They need you on the bridge.

468
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,557
They're starting the face-trace.

469
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,846
See you there.

470
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,437
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

471
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,606
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

472
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,696
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

473
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,111
Trading cards?

474
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,279
They're vintage. He's very proud.

475
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,540
Dr Banner.

476
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,543
Yeah, hi.

477
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,287
They told me you would be coming.

478
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,713
Word is, you can find the Cube.

479
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,674
Is that the only word on me?

480
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,258
Only word I care about.

481
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,473
It must be strange for you, all of this.

482
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,976
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

483
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,725
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

484
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,895
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

485
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,397
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

486
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,775
Is this a submarine?

487
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,318
Really?

488
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,247
They want me in a submerged,
pressurised, metal container?

489
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,642
No, no, this is much worse.

490
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,516
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

491
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,803
Increase collective to 8.0%.

492
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,526
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

493
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,145
Increase output to capacity.

494
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,443
Power plant performing at capacity.

495
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,152
We are clear.

496
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,817
All engines operating.

497
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:33,660
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

498
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,491
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

499
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,826
Let's vanish.

500
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,166
Engage retro-reflection panels.

501
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,228
Reflection panels engaged.

502
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,393
Gentlemen.

503
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,531
Doctor, thank you for coming.

504
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,740
Thanks for asking nicely.

505
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,375
So, how long am I staying?

506
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,336
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

507
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,663
you're in the wind.

508
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,623
Where are you with that?

509
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,549
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

510
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,626
camera on the planet.

511
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,212
Cell phones, laptops...

512
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,053
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

513
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,429
That's still not gonna find them in time.

514
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,600
You have to narrow your field.

515
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,766
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

516
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,893
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

517
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,808
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

518
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,234
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

519
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,521
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

520
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,281
At least we could rule out a few places.

521
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,567
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

522
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,948
Agent Romanoff,

523
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,155
could you show Dr Banner
to his laboratory, please?

524
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,495
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

525
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,084
Put it over there.

526
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,168
Where did you find all these people?

527
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,175
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

528
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,923
Is this the stuff you need?

529
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,087
Yeah, iridium.

530
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,844
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

531
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,679
It's very hard to get hold of.

532
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,559
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
Knows you need it.

533
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,057
Well, I didn't know.

534
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,430
Hey!

535
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,724
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

536
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,192
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

537
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,268
I know.

538
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,904
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

539
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,449
My next target.

540
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,525
Tell me what you need.

541
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,072
I need a distraction.

542
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,291
And an eyeball.

543
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,546
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

544
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,717
No, no. It's fine.

545
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,636
It's a vintage set.

546
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,096
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

547
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,728
Near mint.

548
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,309
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

549
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,895
We got a hit. A 67% match.

550
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,940
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

551
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,312
Location?

552
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,490
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

553
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,821
He's not exactly hiding.

554
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,992
Captain,

555
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,486
you're up.

556
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,272
Kneel before me.

557
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,032
I said

558
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,990
kneel!

559
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,962
Is not this simpler?

560
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,720
Is this not your natural state?

561
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:28,226
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

562
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,807
that you crave subjugation.

563
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,146
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

564
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,777
in a mad scramble for power,

565
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,197
for identity.

566
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,199
You were made to be ruled.

567
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,113
In the end,

568
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,657
you will always kneel.

569
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,049
Not to men like you.

570
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,007
There are no men like me.

571
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,840
There are always men like you.

572
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,884
Look to your elder, people.

573
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,600
Let him be an example.

574
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,155
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

575
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,568
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

576
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,236
we ended up disagreeing.

577
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,076
The soldier.

578
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,537
The man out of time.

579
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,251
I'm not the one who's out of time.

580
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,253
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

581
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,521
Kneel.

582
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,821
Not today!

583
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,158
The guy's all over the place.

584
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,036
<i>Agent Romanoff. You miss me?</i>

585
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,093
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

586
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,310
<i>Good move.</i>

587
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,363
Mr Stark.

588
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,197
<i>Captain.</i>

589
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,036
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

590
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,200
Not a word.

591
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,585
<i>Just get him here. We're low on time.</i>

592
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,581
I don't like it.

593
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,000
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

594
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,843
I don't remember it being that easy.

595
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,595
This guy packs a wallop.

596
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:13,384
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

597
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,930
What's your thing, Pilates?

598
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,011
What?

599
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,267
It's like calisthenics.

600
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,348
You might have missed
a couple of things

601
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,104
doing time as a Capsicle.

602
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,854
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

603
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,739
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

604
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,734
Where's this coming from?

605
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,286
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

606
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,042
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

607
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,061
What are you doing?

608
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,659
<i>And now there's that guy.</i>

609
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,616
Another Asgardian?

610
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,655
<i>- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.</i>

611
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,450
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.</i>

612
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,368
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

613
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,830
<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>

614
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,678
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

615
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,009
I don't see how I can.

616
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,675
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

617
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,601
There's only one God, ma'am.

618
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,099
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

619
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,779
Where is the Tesseract?

620
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,455
I missed you, too.

621
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,119
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

622
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,118
You should thank me.

623
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,954
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

624
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,873
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

625
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,212
to your precious Earth?

626
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,721
I thought you dead.

627
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,766
Did you mourn?

628
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,969
We all did. Our father...

629
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,188
Your father.

630
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,186
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

631
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,985
We were raised together.

632
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,822
We played together,
we fought together.

633
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,535
Do you remember none of that?

634
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,696
I remember a shadow.

635
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,875
Living in the shade of your greatness.

636
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,584
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

637
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,711
I, who was, and should be, king!

638
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,008
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

639
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,007
for your imagined slights?

640
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,264
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

641
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,974
And you're doing
a marvellous job with that.

642
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,726
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

643
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,648
while you idly fret.

644
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,942
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

645
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,398
You think yourself above them?

646
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,771
Well, yes.

647
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,441
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

648
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,363
A throne would suit you ill.

649
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,367
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

650
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,831
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

651
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,374
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

652
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,633
and when I wield it...

653
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,552
Who showed you this power?

654
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,967
Who controls the would-be king?

655
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,056
- I am a king!
- Not here!

656
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,512
You give up the Tesseract!

657
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,219
You give up this poisonous dream!

658
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,057
You come home.

659
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,150
I don't have it.

660
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,362
You need the Cube to bring me home.

661
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,444
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

662
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,701
You listen well, brother.

663
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,537
I'm listening.

664
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,385
Do not touch me again.

665
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,179
Then don't take my stuff.

666
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,598
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

667
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,468
Shakespeare in the Park?

668
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,101
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

669
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,272
This is beyond you, metal man.

670
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,232
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

671
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,149
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

672
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,525
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

673
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,911
<i>Tourist.</i>

674
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,208
Okay.

675
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,151
Power at 400% capacity.

676
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,569
How about that?

677
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,217
Hey!

678
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,180
That's enough.

679
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,519
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

680
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,147
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

681
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,694
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

682
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,770
Yeah... No.

683
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,489
<i>Bad call. He loves his hammer.</i>

684
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,401
You want me to put the hammer down?

685
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,688
Are we done, here?

686
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,524
In case it's unclear,

687
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,033
if you try to escape,

688
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,204
if you so much as scratch that glass,

689
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,718
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

690
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,674
You get how that works?

691
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,346
Ant, boot.

692
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,183
It's an impressive cage.

693
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,684
Not built, I think, for me.

694
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,190
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

695
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,862
Oh, I've heard.

696
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,739
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

697
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,360
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

698
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,947
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

699
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,242
<i>that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?</i>

700
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,536
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

701
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,829
You threaten my world with war.

702
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:06,169
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

703
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:10,178
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

704
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,385
You have made me very desperate.

705
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,299
You might not be glad that you did.

706
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,064
It burns you to have come so close.

707
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,901
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

708
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,233
unlimited power.

709
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,398
And for what?

710
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,613
A warm light for all mankind to share.

711
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:40,200
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

712
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,507
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

713
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,467
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

714
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,599
Loki's gonna drag this out.

715
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:04,265
So, Thor, what's his play?

716
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,059
He has an army called the Chitauri.

717
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,150
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

718
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,690
He means to lead them
against your people.

719
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,483
They will win him the Earth,

720
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,409
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

721
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,320
An army

722
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,239
from outer space.

723
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,829
So, he's building another portal.

724
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,288
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

725
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,369
Selvig?

726
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,042
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

727
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,378
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

728
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,004
along with one of ours.

729
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,840
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

730
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,262
He's not leading an army from here.

731
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,139
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

732
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,174
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

733
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,510
You could smell crazy on him.

734
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,432
Have care how you speak.

735
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,976
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

736
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,598
And he is my brother.

737
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,688
He killed 80 people in two days.

738
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,644
He's adopted.

739
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,197
I think it's about the mechanics.

740
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,357
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

741
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,483
It's a stabilising agent.

742
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,035
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

743
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,699
I'll fly you to Portland.

744
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,489
Keep love alive.

745
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,578
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

746
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,580
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

747
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:09,043
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

748
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,502
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

749
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,168
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

750
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,837
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

751
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,764
<i>That man is playing Galaga.</i>

752
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,387
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

753
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,557
How does Fury even see these?

754
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,686
He turns.

755
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,856
Sounds exhausting.

756
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,104
The rest of the raw materials,

757
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,069
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

758
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,699
The only major component
he still needs

759
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:41,362
is a power source
of high-energy density.

760
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,657
Something to kick-start the Cube.

761
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,751
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

762
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,918
Last night.

763
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,923
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

764
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,128
Am I the only one who did the reading?

765
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,090
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

766
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,051
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

767
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,716
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

768
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,135
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

769
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,427
the quantum tunnelling effect.

770
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:06,811
Well, if he could do that,

771
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,356
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

772
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,900
Finally, someone who speaks English.

773
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,936
Is that what just happened?

774
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,276
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

775
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,567
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

776
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,576
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

777
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,612
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

778
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,414
Thanks.

779
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,076
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

780
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,586
I was hoping you might join him.

781
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,745
I would start with that stick of his.

782
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,046
It may be magical,

783
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,589
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

784
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,589
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

785
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,712
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

786
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,593
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

787
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,424
into his personal flying monkeys.

788
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,301
Monkeys? I do not understand.

789
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,393
I do.

790
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,098
I understood that reference.

791
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,643
Shall we play, Doctor?

792
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,436
This way, sir.

793
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,126
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

794
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,083
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

795
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,377
But it's going to take weeks to process.

796
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,791
If we bypass their mainframe

797
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,171
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

798
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,462
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

799
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,631
All I packed was a toothbrush.

800
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,305
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

801
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,469
Top ten floors, all R&D.

802
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,305
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

803
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,065
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

804
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,818
I kind of broke Harlem.

805
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,820
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

806
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,822
No tension, no surprises.

807
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,738
- Hey!
- Nothing?

808
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,906
Are you nuts?

809
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:45,986
Jury's out.

810
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,411
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

811
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,488
What's your secret?

812
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,082
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

813
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,158
Is everything a joke to you?

814
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,618
Funny things are.

815
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,578
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

816
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,958
isn't funny.

817
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,039
No offence, Doc.

818
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,749
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

819
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,711
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

820
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,171
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

821
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,222
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

822
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:07,675
Do you think I'm not?

823
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,769
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

824
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,562
What isn't he telling us?

825
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,185
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

826
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,149
You think Fury's hiding something?

827
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,649
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

828
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,571
His secrets have secrets.

829
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,194
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

830
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,861
I just want to finish my work here, and...

831
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,528
Doctor?

832
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,457
"A warm light for all mankind."

833
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,538
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

834
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:39,999
I heard it.

835
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,426
I think that was meant for you.

836
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,339
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

837
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,468
it was still all over the news.

838
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,641
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

839
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,101
building in New York?

840
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:56,182
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

841
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,767
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

842
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,693
It's just the prototype.

843
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,646
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

844
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,485
That's what he's getting at.

845
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,238
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

846
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,199
What are they doing
in the energy business

847
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,574
in the first place?

848
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,741
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

849
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,833
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

850
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:16,876
I'm sorry. Did you say...

851
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:19,080
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

852
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,006
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

853
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,333
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.

854
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,383
Blueberry?

855
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,210
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

856
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,172
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

857
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,132
Historically, not awesome.

858
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,513
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

859
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,219
This is a man who means to start a war

860
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,770
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

861
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,558
We have orders.
We should follow them.

862
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,943
Following's not really my style.

863
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,734
And you're all about style, aren't you?

864
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:46,906
Of the people in this room,

865
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,655
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

866
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:49,906
and, B, not of use?

867
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:54,282
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

868
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:58,084
Just find the Cube.

869
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,966
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

870
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,436
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

871
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,931
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

872
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,857
He does have the jump on us.

873
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,685
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

874
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,612
It's going to blow up in his face.

875
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,815
And I'm going to be there when it does.

876
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,488
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

877
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,745
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

878
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,084
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

879
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,584
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

880
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,164
It's a nightmare.

881
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,377
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

882
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,507
to crawl its way into my heart.

883
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,680
This stops it.

884
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,928
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

885
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,847
not just armour.

886
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,934
It's a terrible privilege.

887
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,683
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

888
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,767
It's different.

889
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,612
Hey, I read all about your accident.

890
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,907
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

891
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,694
So you're saying that the Hulk...

892
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,285
The other guy saved my life?

893
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:18,953
That's nice.

894
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:23,712
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

895
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,881
I guess we'll find out.

896
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,426
You may not enjoy that.

897
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,504
And you just might.

898
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,110
<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>

899
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,987
we moved Jane Foster.

900
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,489
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

901
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:41,164
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

902
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,085
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

903
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:46,877
She'll be safe.

904
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,455
Thank you.

905
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,091
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

906
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,716
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

907
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:56,967
Erik is a good man.

908
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,094
He talks about you a lot.

909
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,135
You changed his life.

910
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,726
You changed everything around here.

911
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,978
They were better as they were.

912
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,686
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

913
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,524
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

914
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,483
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

915
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,319
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

916
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,246
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

917
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,245
Well, they are repulsive.

918
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,836
And they trample everything
in their path.

919
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,760
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

920
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,095
and your people paid the price.

921
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,184
And now, again.

922
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,182
In my youth, I courted war.

923
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,981
War hasn't started yet.

924
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,904
You think you could make Loki tell us

925
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,277
where the Tesseract is?

926
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,701
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

927
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:04,532
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

928
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,457
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

929
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,079
A lot of guys think that

930
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,413
until the pain starts.

931
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,459
What are you asking me to do?

932
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:19,046
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

933
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,213
Loki is a prisoner.

934
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,807
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

935
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,259
that wants to be here?

936
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,237
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

937
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,910
But you figured I'd come.

938
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,074
After.

939
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,575
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

940
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:52,379
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

941
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,839
And I would cooperate.

942
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,958
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

943
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,051
I would say I've expanded his mind.

944
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,757
And once you've won,

945
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,600
once you're king of the mountain,

946
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,560
what happens to his mind?

947
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,392
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

948
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,311
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

949
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,116
Tell me.

950
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,913
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...

951
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:36,210
Well, I made a name for myself.

952
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,384
I have a very specific skill set.

953
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:42,884
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

954
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,430
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

955
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,772
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

956
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,141
He made a different call.

957
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,146
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

958
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,984
Not let you out.

959
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,987
No, but I like this.

960
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,196
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

961
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,581
Regimes fall every day.

962
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,034
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

963
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,164
Or I was.

964
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,163
And what are you now?

965
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:19,792
It's really not that complicated.

966
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:24,004
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

967
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,340
Can you?

968
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:31,687
Can you wipe out that much red?

969
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,351
Dreykov's daughter,

970
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,892
São Paulo,

971
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,237
the hospital fire?

972
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,608
Barton told me everything.

973
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,570
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

974
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,493
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

975
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:51,949
will change anything?

976
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,784
This is the basest sentimentality.

977
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,121
This is a child at prayer.

978
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,375
Pathetic!

979
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,958
<i>You lie and kill</i>

980
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,136
<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>

981
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:11,222
<i>You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,</i>

982
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,221
<i>something that makes up
for the horrors.</i>

983
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,815
<i>But they are part of you.</i>

984
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:21,486
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

985
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,820
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

986
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,152
Slowly, intimately,

987
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,703
in every way he knows you fear.

988
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,622
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

989
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,494
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

990
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,413
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

991
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,921
You're a monster.

992
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,587
Oh, no.

993
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:49,760
You brought the monster.

994
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,428
So, Banner.

995
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:56,600
That's your play.

996
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,847
What?

997
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,475
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

998
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,105
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

999
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,277
Send Thor as well.

1000
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,314
Thank you

1001
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,783
for your cooperation.

1002
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,709
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1003
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,378
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1004
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,380
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1005
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,752
We are. The model's locked

1006
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,504
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1007
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,880
When we get a hit,

1008
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,462
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1009
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:33,050
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1010
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,179
What is "Phase 2"?

1011
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,390
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1012
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,270
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1013
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,064
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1014
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,440
This does not mean that we're making...

1015
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,521
I'm sorry, Nick.

1016
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,982
What were you lying?

1017
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,362
I was wrong, Director.

1018
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,575
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1019
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:52,652
Did you know about this?

1020
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,659
You want to think about
removing yourself

1021
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,863
from this environment, Doctor?

1022
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,824
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1023
01:07:58,116 --> 01:07:59,459
Loki is manipulating you.

1024
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,036
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1025
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,666
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1026
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,997
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1027
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,457
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1028
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,380
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1029
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:11,088
Is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1030
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:12,968
Because of him.

1031
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,841
Me?

1032
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,598
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1033
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,898
who had a grudge match
that levelled a small town.

1034
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:24,101
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1035
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:27,939
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1036
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,149
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1037
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,404
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1038
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,360
And you're not the only threat.

1039
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,531
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1040
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,540
that can't be controlled.

1041
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:40,913
Like you controlled the Cube?

1042
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,289
Your work with the Tesseract

1043
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,962
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1044
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,506
It is a signal to all the realms

1045
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,300
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1046
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,467
A higher form?

1047
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,669
You forced our hand.

1048
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:52,754
We had to come up with something.

1049
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:53,838
A nuclear deterrent.

1050
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,015
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1051
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,513
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1052
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,766
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1053
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,772
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1054
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,973
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1055
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,025
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1056
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,024
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1057
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,980
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1058
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,611
Are you boys really that naïve?

1059
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,613
S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.

1060
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,035
Captain America's on threat watch?

1061
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,111
We all are.

1062
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,697
Wait, you're on that list?

1063
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,373
Are you above or below angry bees?

1064
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,621
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1065
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,997
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1066
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,580
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

1067
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,890
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.</i>

1068
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,183
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

1069
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,352
<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>

1070
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,850
<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>

1071
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,691
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1072
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,367
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1073
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,861
I mean, what are we, a team?

1074
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,993
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1075
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,790
We're a time bomb.

1076
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,039
You need to step away.

1077
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,995
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1078
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,206
You know damn well why. Back off!

1079
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,541
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1080
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:15,254
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1081
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,672
Take that off, what are you?

1082
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,261
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1083
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,220
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1084
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,394
I've seen the footage.

1085
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,639
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1086
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,234
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1087
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,737
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1088
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,902
I think I would just cut the wire.

1089
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,028
Always a way out.

1090
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,408
You may not be a threat

1091
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,330
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1092
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,038
A hero? Like you?

1093
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,211
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1094
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,711
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1095
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,784
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1096
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:24,531
You people are so petty and tiny.

1097
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:25,664
Yeah, this is a team.

1098
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,866
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1099
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:27,996
Dr Banner back to his...

1100
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,832
Where? You rented my room.

1101
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,788
The cell was just in case...

1102
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,290
In case you needed to kill me.

1103
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:36,046
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1104
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,969
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1105
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:46,428
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1106
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,388
So I moved on.

1107
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:51,065
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

1108
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,563
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1109
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,898
and put everyone here at risk.

1110
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,397
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1111
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,073
You want to know how I stay calm?

1112
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,077
Dr Banner,

1113
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,323
put down the sceptre.

1114
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,381
Got it.

1115
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:17,963
Sorry, kids,

1116
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,927
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1117
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,091
You located the Tesseract?

1118
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:22,213
I could get there fastest.

1119
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,474
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1120
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,891
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1121
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,055
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1122
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,435
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1123
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,512
Put on the suit.

1124
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:33,934
Oh, my God.

1125
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:50,700
Put on the suit.

1126
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,126
Yeah.

1127
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,623
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

1128
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,469
<i>- Hill!
- External detonation.</i>

1129
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,967
Number three engine is down.

1130
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,047
We've been hit.

1131
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,383
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

1132
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:07,466
Talk to me.

1133
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,268
Turbine looks mostly intact

1134
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,266
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

1135
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,813
while we're in the air.

1136
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,483
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1137
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,606
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1138
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,153
<i>- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.</i>

1139
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,649
<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section</i>

1140
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:23,824
<i>then get to the armoury.</i>

1141
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,988
Romanoff?

1142
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,993
We're okay.

1143
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:33,914
We're okay, right?

1144
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:47,966
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1145
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,767
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1146
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,719
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1147
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,976
Let's go, Level 4.

1148
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,476
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1149
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,076
Doctor?

1150
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,030
Bruce?

1151
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,122
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1152
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:17,624
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1153
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,704
Are you hurt?

1154
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,176
We're going to be okay. All right?

1155
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,387
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1156
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:28,844
You will walk away and never ever...

1157
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,766
Your life?

1158
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,234
Bruce.

1159
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:28,616
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1160
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,534
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1161
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,616
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1162
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,280
Is the sun coming up?

1163
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,290
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1164
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,118
Get us over water.

1165
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,250
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1166
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,132
Thanks.

1167
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:49,636
Stark!

1168
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,016
Stark, I'm here!

1169
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,308
<i>Good.</i>

1170
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,850
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

1171
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,556
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1172
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:01,724
back online

1173
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,354
before I can access the rotors,

1174
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,027
work on dislodging the debris.

1175
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,148
<i>I need you to get to that
engine control panel</i>

1176
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:12,945
<i>and tell me which relays
are in overload position.</i>

1177
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,833
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

1178
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,052
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1179
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,929
Well, you're not wrong.

1180
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:38,662
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1181
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:39,784
Try to think!

1182
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,792
<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>

1183
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,259
What's our next move?

1184
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:54,633
<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>

1185
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,885
<i>this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.</i>

1186
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,261
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1187
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,184
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1188
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,515
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1189
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:03,938
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

1190
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,268
Speak English!

1191
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,812
You see that red lever?

1192
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,194
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

1193
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,110
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1194
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,413
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1195
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,963
Grenade!

1196
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,434
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

1197
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,608
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear.</i>

1198
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,811
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

1199
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,278
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.</i>

1200
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:43,863
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

1201
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,039
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1202
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,204
Get his attention.

1203
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,755
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1204
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,173
<i>Don't get too close.</i>

1205
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,374
<i>Copy.</i>

1206
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,850
<i>Target acquired.</i>

1207
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,064
<i>Target engaged.</i>

1208
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,247
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

1209
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,902
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1210
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,710
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

1211
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,308
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1212
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,101
<i>Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.</i>

1213
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,679
<i>It's Barton. He took out our systems.</i>

1214
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,265
<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>

1215
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,350
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

1216
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,691
This is Agent Romanoff.

1217
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,272
I copy.

1218
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,660
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

1219
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,238
Yeah, I noticed.

1220
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,350
No!

1221
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,531
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1222
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,123
The humans think us immortal.

1223
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:58,750
Should we test that?

1224
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,462
Move away, please.

1225
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,468
You like this?

1226
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,632
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1227
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,139
Even I don't know what it does.

1228
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,432
Do you want to find out?

1229
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:21,641
No!

1230
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,844
Natasha?

1231
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:06,166
You're going to lose.

1232
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,255
Am I?

1233
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,215
It's in your nature.

1234
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,715
Your heroes are scattered.

1235
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:21,553
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1236
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:22,932
Where is my disadvantage?

1237
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,772
You lack conviction.

1238
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:27,770
I don't think I'm...

1239
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,283
So, that's what it does.

1240
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,116
<i>All hands
to crash stations immediately.</i>

1241
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:09,933
Cap, hit the lever.

1242
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,944
I need a minute here!

1243
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,396
Lever

1244
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,480
now!

1245
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:28,789
<i>Help!</i>

1246
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,784
Sorry, boss.

1247
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:07,411
The god rabbited.

1248
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,201
Just stay awake.

1249
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,752
Eyes on me.

1250
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,413
No, I'm clocking out here.

1251
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:13,876
Not an option.

1252
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,209
It's okay, boss.

1253
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:21,179
This was never gonna work

1254
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:22,426
if they didn't have something

1255
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,350
to...

1256
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:56,415
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

1257
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,501
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

1258
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,086
<i>They're here.</i>

1259
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,929
<i>They called it.</i>

1260
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,821
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1261
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,326
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1262
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,669
We're dead in the air up here.

1263
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:37,873
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1264
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,421
Banner, Thor...

1265
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,629
I got nothing for you.

1266
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,636
I lost my one good eye.

1267
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:52,604
Maybe I had that coming.

1268
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,235
Yes,

1269
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:02,736
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1270
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,072
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1271
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:09,280
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1272
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:17,334
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1273
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:22,589
called the Avengers Initiative.

1274
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,925
The idea was to bring together a group

1275
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,598
of remarkable people

1276
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,185
to see if they could become
something more.

1277
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:37,516
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1278
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:40,982
to fight the battles that we never could.

1279
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:48,866
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1280
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:52,872
In heroes.

1281
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,499
Well,

1282
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:06,052
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1283
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:28,616
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

1284
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,083
Did I hurt anybody?

1285
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:47,511
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1286
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,930
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1287
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:52,848
Lucky.

1288
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,267
Or just good aim.

1289
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:55,973
You were awake when you fell.

1290
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,102
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1291
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:01,938
Right through the ceiling.

1292
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:06,238
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1293
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:07,484
Here.

1294
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,034
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1295
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:13,612
to a regular-size feller.

1296
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:17,248
Thank you.

1297
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:19,163
Are you an alien?

1298
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,001
What?

1299
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:22,663
From outer space, an alien.

1300
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:24,251
No.

1301
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,797
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1302
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,973
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1303
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,649
You know that?

1304
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:49,314
Is that what you know?

1305
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:54,654
I've got no window.

1306
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:56,658
I have to flush him out.

1307
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,574
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1308
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,079
You don't understand.

1309
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:06,165
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1310
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:11,462
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1311
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,720
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1312
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:20,683
You know that I do.

1313
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,233
Why am I back?

1314
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:32,069
How did you get him out?

1315
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:34,867
Cognitive recalibration.

1316
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,659
I hit you really hard on the head.

1317
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:38,863
Thanks.

1318
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:44,873
Natasha...

1319
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:46,663
How many agents did I...

1320
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,293
Don't.

1321
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,634
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1322
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:53,086
This is Loki.

1323
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:55,797
This is monsters and magic,

1324
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,257
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1325
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:58,970
Loki, did he get away?

1326
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,051
Yeah.

1327
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,771
I don't suppose you know where.

1328
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,897
I didn't need to know.

1329
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,725
I didn't ask.

1330
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,231
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1331
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,652
Today.

1332
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,024
We got to stop him.

1333
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:16,993
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1334
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,036
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1335
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,907
Well,

1336
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:25,748
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1337
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:28,588
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1338
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:32,751
Now you sound like you.

1339
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:34,920
But you don't.

1340
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,967
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1341
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:44,805
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1342
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,558
What did Loki do to you?

1343
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,736
He didn't. I just...

1344
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,987
Natasha.

1345
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:01,116
I've been compromised.

1346
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,038
I got red in my ledger.

1347
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,497
I would like to wipe it out.

1348
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,064
Was he married?

1349
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,561
No.

1350
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:33,942
There was a cellist, I think.

1351
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,948
I'm sorry.

1352
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:39,029
He seemed like a good man.

1353
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:41,698
He was an idiot.

1354
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,872
Why? For believing?

1355
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:45,577
For taking on Loki alone.

1356
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,409
He was doing his job.

1357
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,836
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1358
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,003
He should have...

1359
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,831
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1360
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,258
Right, I've heard that before.

1361
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:56,505
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1362
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:58,461
We are not soldiers.

1363
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,767
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1364
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,268
Neither am I.

1365
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,597
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1366
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,102
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1367
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,183
and get this done.

1368
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,393
Loki needs a power source.

1369
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:14,443
If we can put together a list...

1370
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:15,520
He made it personal.

1371
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:16,854
That's not the point.

1372
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:19,444
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1373
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,322
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1374
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:22,740
To tear us apart.

1375
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,696
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1376
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,282
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1377
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:28,958
That's what he wants.

1378
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,286
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1379
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,544
He wants an audience.

1380
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,211
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1381
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:38,294
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1382
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,970
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1383
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,638
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1384
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,218
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1385
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,558
Son of a bitch.

1386
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:01,524
Time to go.

1387
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:03,485
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1388
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:04,702
Can you fly one of those jets?

1389
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:07,530
I can.

1390
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,410
You got a suit?

1391
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:13,619
Yeah.

1392
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,163
Then suit up.

1393
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,151
Hey, you guys aren't
authorised to be in here.

1394
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,448
Son, just don't.

1395
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:49,913
Sir.

1396
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:50,990
Agent Hill.

1397
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:53,334
Those cards,

1398
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:59,458
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1399
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,588
They needed the push.

1400
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,139
<i>We have an unauthorised departure
from Bay 6.</i>

1401
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,263
They found him.

1402
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:18,060
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1403
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,270
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1404
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,743
<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>

1405
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,707
<i>but the device
is already self-sustaining.</i>

1406
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:42,008
<i>Shut it down, Dr Selvig.</i>

1407
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:43,588
It's too late!

1408
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,213
She can't stop now.

1409
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,600
She wants to show us something!

1410
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,970
A new universe.

1411
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:54,391
<i>Okay.</i>

1412
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,779
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

1413
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,482
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

1414
01:39:05,815 --> 01:39:07,658
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

1415
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:09,573
<i>Plan B.</i>

1416
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:13,115
<i>Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.</i>

1417
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:15,291
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1418
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:37,938
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1419
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:41,521
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1420
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:43,152
You should have left
your armour on for that.

1421
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:44,904
Yeah.

1422
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,151
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1423
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:48,449
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

1424
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:51,737
Would you like a drink?

1425
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,036
Stalling me won't change anything.

1426
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:55,498
No, no. Threatening.

1427
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:56,665
No drink? Are you sure?

1428
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:58,621
I'm having one.

1429
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:03,590
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1430
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:05,541
What have I to fear?

1431
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:07,426
The Avengers.

1432
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:12,132
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1433
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:13,888
"Earth's mightiest heroes" -type thing.

1434
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:15,559
Yes, I've met them.

1435
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,852
Yeah.

1436
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:18,353
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1437
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:19,521
I'll give you that one.

1438
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:21,816
But let's do a head count, here.

1439
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:24,440
Your brother, the demigod,

1440
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:29,528
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1441
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:33,035
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1442
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:36,034
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1443
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:39,496
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1444
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:40,622
That was the plan.

1445
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,083
Not a great plan.

1446
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,256
When they come,

1447
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:46,833
and they will,

1448
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:48,042
they'll come for you.

1449
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,172
I have an army.

1450
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,344
We have a Hulk.

1451
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,509
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1452
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:54,556
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1453
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:58,432
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1454
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,771
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1455
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,974
but it's all on you.

1456
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:05,142
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1457
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:08,238
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1458
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,530
How will your friends have time for me

1459
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,202
when they are so busy fighting you?

1460
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:23,665
This usually works.

1461
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,630
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1462
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:28,629
One out of five...

1463
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,338
Jarvis, anytime now.

1464
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,805
You will all fall before me.

1465
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:39,135
Deploy!

1466
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:40,511
Deploy!

1467
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,043
<i>And there's one other
person you pissed off.</i>

1468
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,219
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

1469
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:38,656
Right.

1470
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:39,737
Army.

1471
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:53,728
Loki!

1472
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,563
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1473
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:56,772
You can't.

1474
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:58,820
There is no stopping it.

1475
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:00,655
There is only

1476
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:01,990
the war.

1477
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:03,279
So be it.

1478
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,928
<i>Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.</i>

1479
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:29,180
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1480
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:31,015
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1481
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,785
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

1482
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:52,370
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1483
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,049
- Nat?
- I see him.

1484
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,975
We got to get back up there.

1485
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,732
Stark, are you seeing this?

1486
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:43,860
<i>Seeing. Still working on believing.</i>

1487
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,525
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1488
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:46,741
<i>Banner?</i>

1489
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:47,818
Just keep me posted.

1490
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,579
<i>Jarvis, find me a soft spot.</i>

1491
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:54,750
Look at this!

1492
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:55,826
Look around you!

1493
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,665
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1494
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:02,667
It's too late.

1495
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:05,420
It's too late to stop it.

1496
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:09,052
No. We can, together.

1497
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,765
Sentiment.

1498
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,254
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1499
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:50,255
Loki.

1500
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:03,648
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1501
01:48:09,274 --> 01:48:11,276
We got this. It's good. Go.

1502
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,577
Do you think you can hold them off?

1503
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:13,700
Captain,

1504
01:48:15,864 --> 01:48:18,538
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1505
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,029
Just like Budapest all over again.

1506
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:50,115
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1507
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:07,583
It's going to be an hour

1508
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:09,043
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1509
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:10,969
National Guard?

1510
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,180
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1511
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:14,256
Do we?

1512
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,051
You need men in these buildings.

1513
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,681
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1514
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,013
right into the line of fire.

1515
01:49:20,137 --> 01:49:22,060
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1516
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,766
You keep them off the streets.

1517
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:26,147
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1518
01:49:26,602 --> 01:49:27,979
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1519
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:43,543
I need men in those buildings.

1520
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,747
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1521
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:48,173
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1522
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:00,178
Well, we got its attention.

1523
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:02,434
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

1524
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:32,964
What's the story upstairs?

1525
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:35,011
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1526
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:37,761
<i>Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.</i>

1527
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,513
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1528
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:40,717
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1529
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,182
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1530
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:43,262
Save it.

1531
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,147
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1532
01:50:45,222 --> 01:50:46,269
and that's what we need.

1533
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:48,066
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1534
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,736
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1535
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:02,038
So, this all seems horrible.

1536
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:03,657
I've seen worse.

1537
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,166
Sorry.

1538
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:07,870
No, we could use a little worse.

1539
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:10,415
<i>- Stark, we got him.
- Banner?</i>

1540
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:11,919
Just like you said.

1541
01:51:12,249 --> 01:51:14,843
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1542
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,177
I don't see how that's a party.

1543
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:32,060
Dr Banner.

1544
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,739
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1545
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:39,114
That's my secret, Captain.

1546
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:42,120
I'm always angry.

1547
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,212
<i>Hold on!</i>

1548
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:26,699
Send the rest.

1549
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:34,752
Guys.

1550
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:36,250
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

1551
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:37,585
All right, listen up.

1552
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:40,171
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1553
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:41,922
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1554
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,928
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1555
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:45,099
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1556
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:46,427
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1557
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,178
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1558
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:49,559
<i>- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.</i>

1559
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:50,764
<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

1560
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,520
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1561
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:57,979
Slow them down.

1562
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:00,149
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1563
01:53:02,734 --> 01:53:04,031
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1564
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:05,283
We keep the fighting here.

1565
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:06,363
And Hulk...

1566
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,158
Smash.

1567
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:05,213
Sir.

1568
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:06,965
The Council is on.

1569
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:15,144
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1570
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:19,061
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1571
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:21,321
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1572
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:22,613
So find a tight corner.

1573
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:24,236
I will roger that.

1574
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:48,306
Oh, boy.

1575
01:54:55,514 --> 01:54:57,187
Nice call.

1576
01:54:57,265 --> 01:54:58,517
What else you got?

1577
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,444
<i>Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

1578
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,488
And he didn't invite me.

1579
01:55:43,228 --> 01:55:45,230
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1580
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:46,280
if we don't close that portal.

1581
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:47,608
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1582
01:55:47,983 --> 01:55:50,281
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1583
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,072
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1584
01:55:55,115 --> 01:55:56,241
I got a ride.

1585
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:58,372
I could use a boost, though.

1586
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,038
Are you sure about this?

1587
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:05,050
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1588
01:56:32,235 --> 01:56:34,033
Okay, turn, turn.

1589
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:36,035
Less! Less!

1590
01:57:58,655 --> 01:58:01,659
<i>Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.</i>

1591
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:03,584
<i>They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.</i>

1592
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:05,412
I'm on it.

1593
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:27,355
Everyone! Clear out!

1594
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,098
<i>Director Fury,</i>

1595
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,721
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

1596
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,850
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

1597
01:59:03,928 --> 01:59:05,601
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1598
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,148
I have elected to ignore it.

1599
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:10,318
<i>Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

1600
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:11,440
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

1601
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:14,360
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1602
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:16,779
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1603
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:18,860
I will not order a nuclear strike

1604
01:59:18,943 --> 01:59:20,286
against a civilian population.

1605
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:22,747
<i>If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.</i>

1606
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:25,826
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1607
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:30,922
You.

1608
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:34,758
Hawkeye!

1609
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:36,836
Nat, what are you doing?

1610
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:38,797
A little help?

1611
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:45,220
I got him.

1612
02:00:11,663 --> 02:00:12,664
Enough!

1613
02:00:13,289 --> 02:00:15,508
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1614
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:18,678
I am a god, you dull creature.

1615
02:00:18,753 --> 02:00:20,300
And I will not be bullied by...

1616
02:00:29,806 --> 02:00:31,729
Puny god.

1617
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:41,613
The sceptre...

1618
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:43,991
Doctor.

1619
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:48,701
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1620
02:00:48,783 --> 02:00:50,456
The Tesseract can't fight,

1621
02:00:50,535 --> 02:00:52,378
but you can't protect against yourself.

1622
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:53,584
It's not your fault.

1623
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:54,755
You didn't know what you were doing.

1624
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,387
Actually, I think I did.

1625
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:03,466
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1626
02:01:04,591 --> 02:01:06,093
Loki's sceptre.

1627
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:08,804
It may be able to close the portal.

1628
02:01:10,847 --> 02:01:12,690
And I'm looking right at it.

1629
02:01:25,153 --> 02:01:28,657
<i>Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.</i>

1630
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:38,800
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1631
02:01:38,875 --> 02:01:41,048
<i>I wouldn't consider him a role model.</i>

1632
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:52,707
<i>Director Fury is no longer in command.</i>

1633
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:54,876
<i>Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.</i>

1634
02:02:54,951 --> 02:02:57,420
<i>7- Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.</i>

1635
02:02:58,454 --> 02:03:00,456
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1636
02:03:00,999 --> 02:03:02,797
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1637
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:04,469
We need to shut it down!

1638
02:03:04,544 --> 02:03:06,546
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1639
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:39,546
Stark, do you hear me?

1640
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:41,589
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1641
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,712
<i>How long?</i>

1642
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:45,919
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

1643
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:47,470
<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>

1644
02:03:47,712 --> 02:03:49,589
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1645
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:51,599
<i>I just did.</i>

1646
02:04:04,312 --> 02:04:05,689
<i>Package is sent.</i>

1647
02:04:05,897 --> 02:04:08,867
<i>Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>

1648
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:34,221
Are you ready for another bout?

1649
02:04:34,676 --> 02:04:35,723
What, are you getting sleepy?

1650
02:04:41,474 --> 02:04:43,272
Right at the crown!

1651
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:51,109
I can close it.

1652
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:52,910
Can anybody copy?

1653
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:54,244
I can shut the portal down.

1654
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:56,538
<i>- Do it!
- No, wait.</i>

1655
02:04:56,614 --> 02:04:57,831
Stark, these things are still coming.

1656
02:04:57,907 --> 02:04:58,908
I got a nuke coming in.

1657
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,869
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1658
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:12,510
And I know just where to put it.

1659
02:05:19,887 --> 02:05:22,265
<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>

1660
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:23,770
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1661
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:28,026
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

1662
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:29,856
Might as well.

1663
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:34,489
<i>The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.</i>

1664
02:05:34,569 --> 02:05:36,947
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence</i>

1665
02:05:37,155 --> 02:05:38,702
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

1666
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:41,292
<i>And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,</i>

1667
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:44,120
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

1668
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:45,797
<i>We have limited information
on the team</i>

1669
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:49,634
<i>but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

1670
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:05,042
Come on, Stark.

1671
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:12,587
Close it.

1672
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:33,688
Son of a gun.

1673
02:07:38,568 --> 02:07:40,241
He's not slowing down.

1674
02:07:58,254 --> 02:07:59,551
Is he breathing?

1675
02:08:27,617 --> 02:08:28,834
What the hell?

1676
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:33,919
What just happened?

1677
02:08:34,165 --> 02:08:36,293
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1678
02:08:40,546 --> 02:08:42,014
We won.

1679
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:45,893
All right, yay!

1680
02:08:45,968 --> 02:08:48,016
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1681
02:08:48,095 --> 02:08:51,065
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1682
02:08:52,058 --> 02:08:53,480
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1683
02:08:54,143 --> 02:08:56,271
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1684
02:08:56,354 --> 02:08:58,106
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1685
02:08:58,648 --> 02:08:59,991
We're not finished yet.

1686
02:09:05,071 --> 02:09:06,994
And then shawarma after.

1687
02:09:28,844 --> 02:09:31,188
If it's all the same to you,

1688
02:09:34,392 --> 02:09:36,110
I'll have that drink now.

1689
02:09:43,985 --> 02:09:46,033
<i>Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed</i>

1690
02:09:46,112 --> 02:09:47,910
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

1691
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:49,536
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

1692
02:09:49,657 --> 02:09:51,625
<i>of the group known as the Avengers</i>

1693
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:53,294
<i>has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,</i>

1694
02:09:53,369 --> 02:09:54,370
<i>but for celebration.</i>

1695
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:56,964
<i>It's just really great knowing
they're out there.</i>

1696
02:09:57,039 --> 02:09:58,916
<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>

1697
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,252
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

1698
02:10:00,334 --> 02:10:02,086
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

1699
02:10:02,169 --> 02:10:03,512
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

1700
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:05,009
<i>And this green guy walks up
and he goes...</i>

1701
02:10:05,089 --> 02:10:06,181
<i>I don't know.</i>

1702
02:10:06,257 --> 02:10:08,806
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

1703
02:10:08,884 --> 02:10:11,979
<i>It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

1704
02:10:12,054 --> 02:10:15,308
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

1705
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:17,567
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

1706
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:18,986
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

1707
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:21,314
<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>

1708
02:10:21,397 --> 02:10:23,525
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

1709
02:10:23,607 --> 02:10:26,486
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1710
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:27,661
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

1711
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:29,159
<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

1712
02:10:29,238 --> 02:10:32,082
<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>

1713
02:10:34,076 --> 02:10:37,250
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

1714
02:10:39,373 --> 02:10:42,877
<i>Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,</i>

1715
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,507
<i>I would just...</i>

1716
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:47,598
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

1717
02:10:50,051 --> 02:10:51,598
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

1718
02:10:51,927 --> 02:10:54,100
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1719
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:56,399
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1720
02:10:56,474 --> 02:10:58,101
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

1721
02:10:58,184 --> 02:11:00,278
<i>The Tesseract is where it belongs.</i>

1722
02:11:00,895 --> 02:11:03,273
<i>Out of our reach.</i>

1723
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:04,903
<i>That's not your call.</i>

1724
02:11:04,982 --> 02:11:06,029
I didn't make it.

1725
02:11:06,150 --> 02:11:08,244
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1726
02:11:08,527 --> 02:11:10,200
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

1727
02:11:10,446 --> 02:11:12,119
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

1728
02:11:12,198 --> 02:11:13,996
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

1729
02:11:14,075 --> 02:11:16,419
<i>I think he will be.</i>

1730
02:11:30,132 --> 02:11:32,510
<i>I don't think you understand
what you've started,</i>

1731
02:11:32,885 --> 02:11:35,183
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

1732
02:11:35,596 --> 02:11:36,643
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1733
02:11:37,014 --> 02:11:40,518
<i>They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.</i>

1734
02:11:41,227 --> 02:11:43,571
Every world knows it.

1735
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:46,198
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

1736
02:11:46,482 --> 02:11:48,029
<i>A statement?</i>

1737
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:52,405
<i>A promise.</i>

1738
02:12:00,871 --> 02:12:02,464
<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>

1739
02:12:03,749 --> 02:12:05,797
They've gone their separate ways.

1740
02:12:05,876 --> 02:12:08,846
Some, pretty extremely far.

1741
02:12:09,547 --> 02:12:11,549
If we get into a situation like this again,

1742
02:12:11,632 --> 02:12:12,975
what happens then?

1743
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:14,097
They'll come back.

1744
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:17,263
Are you really sure about that?

1745
02:12:17,346 --> 02:12:18,347
I am.

1746
02:12:20,224 --> 02:12:21,521
Why?

1747
02:12:22,518 --> 02:12:24,395
Because we'll need them to.

1748
02:15:16,275 --> 02:15:18,824
Humans.

1749
02:15:20,029 --> 02:15:24,455
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1750
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:27,540
They stand.

1751
02:15:28,370 --> 02:15:33,592
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1752
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:44,724
To challenge them

1753
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:48,182
is to court death.
