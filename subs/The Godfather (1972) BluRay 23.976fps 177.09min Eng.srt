1
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,662
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,707
America has made my fortune.

3
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,919
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:31,841
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,429
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,933
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,727
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:48,524
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,195
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,657
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,870
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,208
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:12,006
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,552
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,183
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,730
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,735
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,405
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,037
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,962
Sorry.

21
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,933
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,686
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,565
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,775
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,948
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,537
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,124
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

28
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:34,964
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice, we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,765
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:50,980
What do you want of me? Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,732
What is that?

32
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,703
I want them dead.

33
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,133
That I cannot do.

34
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,970
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,072
I've known you many years,

36
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:30,928
but this is the first time
you've asked for help.

37
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:37,109
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

38
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,031
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

39
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:47,119
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

40
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,957
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

41
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,459
I didn't want to get into trouble.

42
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,212
I understand.

43
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,591
You found Paradise in America.

44
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,571
You made a good living,
had police protection

45
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,589
and there were courts of law.

46
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,351
You didn't need a friend like me.

47
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,564
But now you come to me and say,

48
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,067
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

49
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,822
But you don't ask with respect.

50
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:27,618
You don't offer friendship.
You don't even think to call me Godfather.

51
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:36,210
You come on my daughter's wedding day
and ask me to murder for money.

52
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,838
I ask you for justice.

53
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,924
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

54
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,429
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

55
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,850
How much shall I pay you?

56
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,452
Bonasera, Bonasera.

57
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,622
What have I ever done to make you treat me
so disrespectfully?

58
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,293
If you'd come in friendship,

59
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,797
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

60
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:28,095
And if an honest man like you
should make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

61
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,851
And then they would fear you.

62
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,482
Be my friend?

63
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,987
Godfather?

64
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,534
Good.

65
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,833
Some day, and that day may never come,
I'll ask a service of you.

66
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,337
But until that day

67
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,426
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

68
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,929
<Gràzie>, Godfather.

69
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,930
Prego.

70
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,688
Give this to Clemenza.

71
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,444
I want people that aren't going
to get carried away.

72
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,698
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[FarangSiam thanks you.
Enjoy!]

74
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,394
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

75
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,606
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

76
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,407
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

77
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,750
Don Barzini.

78
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,436
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

79
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,772
Paulie! More wine.

80
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:31,820
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

81
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,156
Take a walk and do your job.

82
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,167
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

83
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,711
You watch yourself, all right?

84
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:13,112
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

85
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,448
In that little silk purse.

86
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,119
If this were somebody else's wedding...
<Sfortunato>!
[Unlucky guy]

87
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,453
Hey, Paulie!

88
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,232
I got two <gabagool, capocol>,
[Spicy Italian sausage-Italian Classic ham]

89
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
and a <prosciut>.
[Dry-ish sweet tasting ham]

90
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:26,928
Stupid jerk!

91
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,553
What's the matter?

92
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,401
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

93
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,739
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

94
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:07,583
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

95
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,632
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

96
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,678
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

97
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,979
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

98
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,361
Come here, come here, come here!

99
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:54,171
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

100
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,341
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

101
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,177
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

102
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,221
Now that the war is over,

103
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,308
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

104
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:11,271
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

105
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,985
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

106
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,447
You understand everything.

107
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,659
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

108
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,749
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

109
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,585
The bride, the groom and the angel...

110
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:43,387
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our <paisan>.
[County]

111
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:48,600
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

112
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,234
Hey, Michael!

113
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,507
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

114
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,724
Is this necessary?

115
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,597
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding,

116
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:33,470
so he wanted to thank you.

117
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:40,194
Don Corleone, I'm honored and grateful
that you have invited me

118
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,113
on the wedding day of your daughter.

119
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,616
May their first child be a masculine child.

120
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,243
Michael...

121
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,415
That man over there is talking to himself.

122
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,335
See that scary guy over there?

123
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,922
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

124
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,676
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

125
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,389
Michael, he's coming over here!

126
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,562
You look terrific!

127
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,941
My brother Tom Hagen, Miss Kay Adams.

128
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,945
Your father's been asking for you.

129
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,864
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

130
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,327
Why does your brother
have a different name?

131
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,289
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

132
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,293
He had no home, so my father took him in.

133
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,131
He's been with us ever since.

134
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,175
He's a good lawyer.

135
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,042
Not a Sicilian.

136
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,704
- I think he's going to be <consigliere>.
[An adviser or counselor]

137
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,628
- What's that?
- That's a...
[especially to a capo or leader]

138
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,479
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.
[of an organized crime syndicate.]

139
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,649
You like your lasagna?

140
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,114
Don Corleone.

141
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,866
I'm honored and grateful

142
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,787
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

143
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,087
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

144
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:27,009
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

145
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:33,557
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

146
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:40,939
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

147
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:46,153
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you now,
because I know you're busy.

148
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,030
Thank you.

149
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,873
Signora Corleone!

150
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,919
No!

151
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,118
Senator Cauley apologized for not coming,
but said you'd understand.

152
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,456
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

153
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,710
What is that outside?

154
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,348
Johnny! Johnny!

155
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,059
I love you!

156
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,782
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

157
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,368
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

158
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,707
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

159
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,142
You never said you knew Johnny Fontane!

160
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:08,313
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

161
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,234
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

162
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,401
How?

163
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,782
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

164
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,276
Please, Michael. Tell me.

165
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,632
When Johnny was starting out,

166
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,859
he was signed to
a personal service contract

167
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,787
with a big bandleader.

168
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,125
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

169
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,879
Johnny is my father's godson.

170
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,299
My father went to see this bandleader.

171
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:21,261
He offered him $ 10,000 to let Johnny go,

172
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,097
but the bandleader said no.

173
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:29,561
So the next day my father went to see him,
but this time with Luca Brasi.

174
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,565
Within an hour,

175
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:39,154
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1,000.

176
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,118
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

177
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:51,666
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

178
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:57,005
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

179
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,637
That's a true story.

180
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,734
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

181
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,998
Beautiful!

182
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,366
I'll take care of it.

183
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,326
Tom...

184
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:12,122
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

185
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,340
How are you, Fredo?

186
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,010
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

187
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,388
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

188
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,853
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

189
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,522
Yeah. This is your friend?

190
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:42,277
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

191
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:50,452
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

192
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:55,874
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

193
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,210
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

194
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,465
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

195
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,020
Sonny?

196
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,068
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

197
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,028
The old man wants you.

198
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,989
One minute.

199
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,135
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book,

200
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:47,500
a best-seller.

201
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,137
The main character is a guy just like me.

202
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,890
I wouldn't even have to act.

203
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,685
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

204
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:03,274
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

205
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,312
Is this how you turned out?

206
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:09,105
A Hollywood <finocchio>
that cries like a woman?
[Fennel-->Italian slang for homosexual]

207
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:13,201
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

208
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,994
Ridiculous.

209
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,836
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

210
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,546
Good.

211
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:29,300
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

212
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:38,393
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

213
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,835
Rest, and in a month

214
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:43,806
this Hollywood big shot
will give you what you want.

215
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,985
It's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

216
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,238
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

217
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:58,079
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

218
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,293
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

219
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,656
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

220
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,368
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

221
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:42,790
Never. Give him a living, but never discuss
the family business with him.

222
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,668
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

223
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:50,215
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

224
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,719
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

225
00:25:54,845 --> 00:26:00,141
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

226
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:05,605
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

227
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,735
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

228
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,571
Wait a minute.

229
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,949
No, Michael. Not me.

230
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,331
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

231
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,652
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

232
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:20,156
I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane.

233
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,993
This friend would give his friendship
to Mr. Woltz,

234
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,913
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.

235
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,332
Woltz is listening.

236
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,503
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

237
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:44,222
And what favor would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

238
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:47,850
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

239
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:52,021
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

240
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:56,401
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

241
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,070
Let me lay it on the line.

242
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,155
Johnny Fontane will never get that movie!

243
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,579
No matter how many <Dago, Guinea,>
[Ethnic slurs for Italian]

244
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:05,818
<Greaseballs> come out of the woodwork!
[or Latin American]

245
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,705
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

246
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,168
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

247
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,630
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

248
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,259
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

249
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,344
I'll wait for your call.

250
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,057
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.

251
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,355
Check him out.

252
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,422
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

253
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:04,010
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

254
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,471
Why didn't you say you work for Corleone?

255
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:10,808
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

256
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,228
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

257
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,815
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

258
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,485
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

259
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,491
There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.

260
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:30,536
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

261
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:34,081
Khartoum.

262
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:40,004
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

263
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,132
Thanks, Tony.

264
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,844
Let's get something to eat.

265
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,348
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

266
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:54,852
To the Italian people that's a very sacred,
close relationship.

267
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:58,856
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

268
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,275
This favor I can't give him.

269
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,654
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

270
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:10,910
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

271
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,664
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

272
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,876
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

273
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,121
Johnny Fontane ruined

274
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:25,583
one of Woltz International's
most valuable proteges.

275
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:31,013
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

276
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,058
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her,

277
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,759
to make her a big star.

278
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,604
Let me be even more frank.

279
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,307
To show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man.

280
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:43,726
That it's not all dollars and cents.

281
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:47,405
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

282
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:52,910
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

283
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:59,125
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

284
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,918
And she runs off.

285
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,340
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

286
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:11,596
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

287
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,015
You get the hell out of here!

288
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:18,477
If that <goomba> tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.
[Term of endearment for a close friend]

289
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,773
Yeah, I heard that story.

290
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,612
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

291
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,573
Maybe your car can take me to the airport.

292
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,243
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

293
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,860
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

294
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,029
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

295
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,364
Now...

296
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,911
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

297
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,955
He's supposed to be very good with a knife,

298
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,460
«but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.»

299
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,796
«His business is narcotics.»

300
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,258
«He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.»

301
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:58,179
«In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.»

302
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,766
«He needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.»

303
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,770
«He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.»

304
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:11,108
«The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.»

305
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,989
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

306
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,825
He's known as a top narcotics man.

307
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,580
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

308
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,292
Tom?

309
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,546
«Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.»

310
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,650
«If we don't get into it,
somebody else will,»

311
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,417
«maybe the five families.»

312
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,931
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

313
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,099
Then they come after us.

314
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:50,731
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

315
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:55,945
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

316
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,577
So? What's your answer going to be, Pop?

317
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,084
Don Corleone.

318
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,464
I need a man who has powerful friends.

319
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,300
I need a million dollars in cash.

320
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:22,277
I need those politicians
that you carry in your pocket,

321
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:24,256
like nickels and dimes.

322
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:29,687
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

323
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:33,732
In the first year your end should be three,
four million dollars.

324
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,818
And then it would go up.

325
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,447
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

326
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,285
My compliments.

327
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,375
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

328
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,754
So I receive 30% for finance,

329
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,174
political influence and legal protection?

330
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,968
That's right.

331
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,181
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

332
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:11,562
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

333
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,814
<Te salud, Don Corleone.>
[Cheers]

334
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:29,580
I said that I would see you,
because I heard you were a serious man,

335
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,916
to be treated with respect.

336
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,882
But, I must say no to you.

337
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,886
And I'll give you my reason.

338
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,805
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

339
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:52,478
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

340
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:58,192
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

341
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:03,280
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

342
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:08,619
But your business is... a little dangerous.

343
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:13,123
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

344
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,710
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

345
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,806
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

346
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,142
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

347
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,270
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final.

348
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:37,681
I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

349
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,193
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

350
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:46,115
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

351
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,679
Santino.

352
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,597
Come here.

353
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,852
What's the matter with you?

354
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:19,565
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

355
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:23,777
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

356
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,321
Go on.

357
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,120
Tom, what's this nonsense?

358
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,623
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

359
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,545
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

360
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,381
And

361
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,593
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

362
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,144
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

363
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,189
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

364
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,818
Go to the Tattaglias.

365
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:09,198
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

366
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,951
and find out what you can.

367
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,722
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

368
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:38,477
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

369
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,814
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

370
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,639
Andiamo, Fredo.

371
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,143
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

372
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:23,230
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

373
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,235
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

374
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,124
<Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.>
[Merry Christmas, Dear. Thank you.]

375
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:20,746
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

376
00:42:22,097 --> 00:42:23,766
You want Scotch? Pre-war!

377
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:26,651
<I don't drink.>

378
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,673
You know who I am?

379
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,091
<I know you.>

380
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,971
<You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?>

381
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,976
<I think you and I can do business.>

382
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,481
<I need someone strong like you.>

383
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,943
<I heard you are not happy...>

384
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,654
<...with the Corleone family.>

385
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,156
<Want to join me?>

386
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,284
<What's in it for me?>

387
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,831
<$50,000 to start with.>

388
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,085
<Not bad!>

389
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,380
<Agreed?>

390
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,526
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

391
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:19,573
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

392
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,701
Make time, <Consigliere>. Get in the car.

393
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,057
What are you worried about?

394
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:29,074
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

395
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,584
Get in.

396
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:45,307
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

397
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,941
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

398
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:26,533
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

399
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,662
No.

400
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:35,125
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

401
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,671
Michael.

402
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,174
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

403
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,050
What's the matter?

404
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,612
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

405
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:29,179
- Sonny, it's Michael.
«- Where have you been?»

406
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,015
- Is he all right?
«- We don't know yet.»

407
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,144
«There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.»

408
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,358
«- Are you there?»
- Yeah, I'm here.

409
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:46,363
«- Where have you been? I was worried.»
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

410
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:50,492
«No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?»

411
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,543
Oh, my God.

412
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:04,965
Sonny!

413
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,142
Stay back there.

414
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,895
- Who is it?
«- Open up, it's Clemenza.»

415
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,568
There's more news about your old man.

416
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,820
Word is out that he's already dead.

417
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:31,157
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

418
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,578
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

419
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,080
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

420
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,959
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

421
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:45,880
I don't care how sick he is.
Bring him to my father's house right now.

422
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,050
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

423
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:02,230
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

424
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,319
- Hello?
~- Santino Corleone?~

425
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,238
- Yeah.
~- We have Tom Hagen.~

426
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:14,034
~In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.~

427
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:17,454
~Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.~

428
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:22,167
~What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.~

429
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,960
I'll wait.

430
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,310
Your boss is dead.

431
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:47,567
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

432
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:52,530
I want you to help the Corleones and me.

433
00:49:56,494 --> 00:50:00,997
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

434
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,708
Drink it.

435
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,925
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

436
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,932
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

437
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,144
And you knew it was the right thing to do.

438
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:29,442
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

439
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:37,367
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

440
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:42,539
The other New York families will go along
with anything to prevent war.

441
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:47,836
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

442
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,842
Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?

443
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:01,683
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

444
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:09,357
You've got to talk to Sonny,
to the Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

445
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,406
It's good business, Tom.

446
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:22,620
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

447
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,459
Yeah, well...

448
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,671
Let me worry about Luca.

449
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,262
You just talk to Sonny.

450
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,598
And the other two kids.

451
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,061
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

452
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,858
Now you can go.

453
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:03,369
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

454
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,914
Blood is a big expense.

455
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,020
He's still alive.

456
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:33,066
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

457
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,552
That's bad luck for me,

458
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:37,937
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

459
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,438
Your mother is at the hospital
with your father.

460
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,486
Looks like he'll pull through.

461
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,207
It's a lot of bad blood.

462
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:35,953
Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia,
Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

463
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:39,424
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

464
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,968
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

465
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:46,347
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

466
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:50,226
If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

467
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:53,897
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

468
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:58,026
- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

469
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:05,325
Well, Tom, you're <consigliere>.
What do we do if the old man dies?

470
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,195
If we lose the old man,

471
00:54:08,229 --> 00:54:12,698
we lose the political contacts
and half our strength.

472
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:18,421
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

473
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:23,051
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

474
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,802
If your father dies

475
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,973
you make the deal.

476
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:33,937
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

477
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,026
What is it?

478
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:46,824
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

479
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:49,035
Tessio, go see what it is.

480
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,624
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

481
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:58,461
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

482
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:02,131
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

483
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,842
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

484
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:12,642
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

485
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,312
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

486
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:20,692
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

487
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:24,487
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up
in this too directly.

488
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,743
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

489
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,538
Try Luca again.

490
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,216
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

491
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,177
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

492
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,985
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

493
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,737
Probably late.

494
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,951
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

495
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:18,708
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

496
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:23,671
Sonny's running wild.
He wants to go to mattresses already.

497
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:29,635
We have to find a spot on the West Side.
Try 309 West 43rd Street.

498
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,222
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

499
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:37,060
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

500
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,895
Watch the kids.

501
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,863
Paulie, go down 39th Street,

502
00:56:51,897 --> 00:56:55,611
pick up 18 mattresses
and bring me the bill.

503
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,080
Yeah, all right.

504
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:01,584
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

505
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:05,922
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

506
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,967
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

507
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:12,658
Hey, Paulie - Did you fart?

508
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,185
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

509
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,272
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

510
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,334
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

511
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,380
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

512
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,638
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

513
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,353
- Hello. Kay?
~- How's your father?~

514
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,439
He's going to make it.

515
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,733
~I love you.~

516
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,777
~I love you!~

517
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:55,239
~- Michael?~
- Yeah, I know.

518
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:58,242
~- Tell me you love me.~
- I can't talk.

519
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:00,203
Can't you say it?

520
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,289
I'll see you tonight.

521
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,210
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

522
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,969
I love you with all my heart.

523
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:12,122
If I don't see you again soon,
I'm going to die!

524
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,801
Come and learn something.

525
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:18,087
You might have to cook
for 20 guys some day.

526
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:21,766
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

527
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:27,521
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

528
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:31,692
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

529
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,655
Add a little bit of wine.

530
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:43,329
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

531
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,614
Cut the crap. I have more
important things for you.

532
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:47,741
How's Paulie?

533
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:50,002
You won't see him no more.

534
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,965
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

535
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:57,551
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

536
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:00,972
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

537
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,057
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

538
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,479
Send somebody with him anyway.

539
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,593
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

540
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:45,725
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

541
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,935
I'll wait in the cab.

542
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:53,190
I don't want you to get involved.

543
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,154
When will I see you again?

544
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,622
Go back to New Hampshire,
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

545
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:15,087
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

546
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:31,140
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

547
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,727
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

548
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,146
What happened to the guards?

549
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:42,651
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

550
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:46,071
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

551
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,538
Get me Long Beach 4 5 6 2 0, please.

552
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,418
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

553
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:08,302
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

554
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:12,681
No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody.
Papa's all alone.

555
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,267
~- Don't panic.~
- I won't panic.

556
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,605
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

557
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:25,152
We're going to move him to another room.

558
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:28,239
Can you disconnect the tubes?

559
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:31,867
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

560
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:36,247
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

561
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,123
Help me, please.

562
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,996
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

563
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,082
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

564
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:05,294
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

565
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,618
If there is trouble,
I'll stay here to help you.

566
01:06:08,652 --> 01:06:10,040
For your father.

567
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:16,138
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

568
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,307
I'll be out in a minute.

569
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:35,824
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

570
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,828
I'm with you now.

571
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,998
I'm with you.

572
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,619
Get rid of these. Come here.

573
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,545
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun.

574
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:26,032
You'll be all right.

575
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,011
You did good.

576
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,771
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

577
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:15,484
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

578
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,488
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

579
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:25,536
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

580
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:29,665
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

581
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:33,585
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

582
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:42,010
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

583
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,971
Stand him up straight.

584
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,114
I'm the Corleones' attorney.

585
01:10:08,148 --> 01:10:11,781
These men are hired
to protect Vito Corleone.

586
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,251
They're licensed to carry firearms.

587
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:18,755
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

588
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,841
Let him go.

589
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,169
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

590
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,130
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

591
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,383
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

592
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,511
Jesus Christ.

593
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,687
Looks like a fortress around here.

594
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,960
<Tamaduch!> Hey...
[Linguistic expression: We are ready!]

595
01:11:19,965 --> 01:11:23,199
A 100 buttonmen on the street
24 hours a day.

596
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,865
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

597
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,994
Mike, let me look at you.

598
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,085
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

599
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:43,799
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

600
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,635
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

601
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,960
What did he say...

602
01:11:47,994 --> 01:11:51,589
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

603
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:55,102
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

604
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,271
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

605
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:02,651
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

606
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,862
No more! Not this time, <Consigliere>.

607
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:09,491
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

608
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,619
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

609
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:15,664
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

610
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,041
This is business, not personal!

611
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:22,546
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

612
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:27,217
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

613
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:31,304
No more advice on how to patch things up.
Just help me win.

614
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:41,523
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

615
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:45,902
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

616
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:50,032
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

617
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:53,869
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

618
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:57,539
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

619
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:03,587
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

620
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:07,507
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

621
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:12,637
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.

622
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:18,477
All right, we'll wait.

623
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,735
We can't wait. We can't wait.

624
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:32,157
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

625
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,952
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

626
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:40,332
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

627
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:45,003
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

628
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:53,053
They want to have a meeting with me, right?

629
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:58,350
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

630
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,354
Let's set the meeting.

631
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:08,235
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

632
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:13,865
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

633
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,702
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

634
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,458
They'll search me when I meet them, right?

635
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,877
So I can't have a weapon on me.

636
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:34,219
But if Clemenza can figure out a way
to have a weapon planted there for me

637
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,393
then I'll kill them both.

638
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:58,201
Nice college boy. Didn't want
to get mixed up in the family business.

639
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,955
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

640
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:05,671
This isn't like the army!
You have to get close

641
01:15:05,705 --> 01:15:08,620
and get their brains on your suit.

642
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,715
You're taking this very personal.

643
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:15,218
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

644
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,805
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

645
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:25,020
I'm talking about a cop
who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop.

646
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:30,358
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

647
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:31,901
That's a terrific story.

648
01:15:31,935 --> 01:15:35,063
We have newspaper people
on the payroll, right?

649
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:40,327
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

650
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,584
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

651
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,339
It's as cold as they come.

652
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:55,675
Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

653
01:15:56,093 --> 01:16:00,138
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

654
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,402
Is the trigger too tight?

655
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,949
My ears!

656
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:23,662
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

657
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,749
You've shot them both. Now what do you do?

658
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,797
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

659
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:37,425
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

660
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,930
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

661
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,891
so walk out fast, but don't run.

662
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:48,395
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

663
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,982
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

664
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:58,280
You'll be all right.
You'll take a vacation, nobody knows where,

665
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,448
and we'll catch the hell.

666
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:04,911
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

667
01:17:04,996 --> 01:17:08,039
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

668
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:11,589
These things have to happen
every five, 10 years.

669
01:17:11,623 --> 01:17:13,745
Gets rid of the bad blood.

670
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:18,258
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

671
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:21,573
Like they should have
stopped Hitler in Munich,

672
01:17:21,607 --> 01:17:24,130
not letting him get away with it.

673
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:30,020
You know, Mike, we were all proud of you.
Being a hero and all.

674
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,813
Your father too.

675
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:13,313
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

676
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:18,526
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

677
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,945
How much time do we have?

678
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:26,618
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

679
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:32,499
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

680
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:38,421
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

681
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:43,635
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

682
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,097
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

683
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:51,226
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

684
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,646
Sollozzo might not even be in the car,
Sonny!

685
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,231
I'll get it.

686
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,675
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

687
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,095
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

688
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:32,934
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day.
He'll be there between 8 and 10.

689
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:37,897
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

690
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:42,944
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

691
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:48,867
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

692
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,955
We might be able to tape the gun behind it.

693
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:58,168
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

694
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:02,130
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

695
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:07,552
Then you go to take a leak.
No, better still, you ask permission to go.

696
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:12,098
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

697
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:16,352
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

698
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:19,939
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

699
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:25,570
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

700
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,322
Let's move.

701
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,997
Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?

702
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,957
Yeah, a million times.

703
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:46,925
Don't forget. Two shots a piece in the head
as soon as you come out.

704
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:57,101
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

705
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:00,021
At least a year.

706
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:04,943
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

707
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:10,323
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

708
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,664
Take care.

709
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,210
Take care, Mike.

710
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:58,830
I'm glad you came.
I hope we can straighten everything out.

711
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:05,128
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

712
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:09,549
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

713
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,885
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

714
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:17,181
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

715
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:21,686
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

716
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:25,231
He's a good kid.

717
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,697
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

718
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:36,868
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

719
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:46,669
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

720
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:51,924
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

721
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,637
He's clean.

722
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,540
Going to Jersey?

723
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,586
Maybe.

724
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,655
Nice work, Lou.

725
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:38,364
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

726
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:40,116
I'll have it.

727
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,863
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

728
01:25:25,768 --> 01:25:27,227
<- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.>

729
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:37,865
<What happened to your father
was business.>

730
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,410
<I have much respect for your father...>

731
01:25:42,454 --> 01:25:44,956
<but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.>

732
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:51,004
<You must understand why I did what I did.>

733
01:25:52,673 --> 01:25:55,071
<I understand these things.>

734
01:25:56,011 --> 01:25:56,844
<I do.>

735
01:25:57,263 --> 01:25:58,305
<You do.>

736
01:26:10,607 --> 01:26:15,820
<Now we have to think about what happens
between you and the Tattaglias.>

737
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:21,764
<We have to work through where
we go from here.>

738
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:36,048
<How do I say..?>

739
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,152
What I want...

740
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,281
What's most important to me

741
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:50,246
is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

742
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:55,084
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

743
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:58,713
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

744
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,631
I'm not that clever.

745
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,385
All I want is a truce.

746
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:14,770
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

747
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:18,649
When you got to go, you got to go.

748
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:26,073
He's clean.

749
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:28,242
Don't take too long.

750
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,164
I've frisked a thousand punks.

751
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,931
<Everything all right?>

752
01:28:53,024 --> 01:28:54,741
<I respect myself, understand?>

753
01:28:55,468 --> 01:28:57,586
<And so I cannot allow your father
to hold me back.>

754
01:28:59,237 --> 01:29:00,799
<What happened was unavoidable.>

755
01:29:03,893 --> 01:29:05,912
<I had the unspoken support
of the other Dons.>

756
01:29:08,764 --> 01:29:11,684
<If your father were in better health...>

757
01:29:11,815 --> 01:29:13,900
<without his eldest son running things...>

758
01:29:13,933 --> 01:29:15,733
<No disrespect intended,
we wouldn't have this nonsense.>

759
01:29:15,766 --> 01:29:17,328
<We will stop fighting
until your father is well>

760
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:18,344
<and can resume bargaining.>

761
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:19,899
<No vengeance will be taken.
We will have peace.>

762
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,300
<But your Family should interfere no longer.>

763
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,789
Okay, you take over.

764
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:44,892
I love you, Grandpa.

765
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:50,522
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

766
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,944
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

767
01:32:55,070 --> 01:33:01,325
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

768
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:06,622
Go with your mother.

769
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:08,832
Take them downstairs.

770
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:17,007
Go on, Carlo, you too.

771
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:20,427
Go on.

772
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:45,035
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

773
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,583
Since McCluskey's killing,

774
01:34:02,617 --> 01:34:06,673
the police have cracked down
on our operations.

775
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:13,272
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

776
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:16,859
They hit us, so we hit them back.

777
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:22,239
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

778
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:26,618
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

779
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,829
So things are loosening up.

780
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:34,835
And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,

781
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,463
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

782
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:42,092
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

783
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:52,227
Where's Michael?

784
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:07,659
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

785
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:13,290
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

786
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:37,072
I want you to find out
where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

787
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,108
I want him now.

788
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:42,736
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

789
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:46,126
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell will break loose.

790
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,566
Pop can negotiate.

791
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:53,622
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

792
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:57,543
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

793
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:02,589
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

794
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:06,520
Do as I say!
If I had a Sicilian wartime <consigliere>,

795
01:36:06,554 --> 01:36:08,795
I wouldn't be in this shape!

796
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:11,140
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

797
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:17,020
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

798
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:21,150
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

799
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:26,447
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

800
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:30,701
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

801
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,121
That's because they've started
making big money.

802
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:37,499
Papa never talked business at the table.

803
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:41,462
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

804
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,297
Don't interfere.

805
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:49,511
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

806
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:52,389
We don't discuss business at the table.

807
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:42,231
<I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.>

808
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:49,780
<Why are you so far from the house?>

809
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:53,116
<You know I'm responsible to
your father for your life.>

810
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,493
<The bodyguards are here.>

811
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,745
<It's still dangerous...>

812
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,623
<We've heard from Santino in New York...>

813
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,293
<Your enemies know you're here.>

814
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,047
<Did Santino say when I can go back?>

815
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,007
<Not yet.>

816
01:38:09,676 --> 01:38:11,510
<It's out of the question.>

817
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:16,390
<Where are you going now?>

818
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,101
<To Corleone.>

819
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:20,978
<Take my car.>

820
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:25,357
<I want to walk.>

821
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,152
<Be careful.>

822
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,063
Where have all the men gone?

823
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:09,517
They're all dead from <vendettas>.
[a blood feud in which the family
of a murdered person]

824
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:13,462
There are the names of the dead.
[seeks vengeance on the murderer
or the murderer's family]

825
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:32,883
<Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!>

826
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:37,262
<Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!>

827
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:42,643
<America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!>

828
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:03,221
<Mamma Mia> what a beauty!
[Italian expression who denoting a surprise]

829
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:13,882
I think you got hit by the thunderbolt.

830
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:24,101
In Sicily women are more dangerous
than shotguns.

831
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,959
Did you have a good hunt?

832
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:52,295
You know all the girls around here?

833
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,297
We saw some real beauties.

834
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:58,635
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

835
01:41:01,848 --> 01:41:04,599
She would tempt the devil himself.

836
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,401
Really put together.

837
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,527
Right, Calo?

838
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:21,283
Such hair, such mouth!

839
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:26,830
The girls around here are beautiful...
but virtuous.

840
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:29,750
This one had a purple dress...

841
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:32,252
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

842
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:36,298
A type more Greek than Italian.

843
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:40,552
Do you know her?

844
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:47,768
There's no girl like that in this town.

845
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,688
My God, I understand!

846
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:56,818
What's wrong?

847
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,405
Let's go.

848
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:03,617
It's his daughter.

849
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:05,577
Tell him to come here.

850
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:10,332
Call him.

851
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:32,729
Fabrizio, you translate.

852
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:38,735
I apologize if I offended you.

853
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:43,156
I'm a stranger in this country.

854
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:46,326
I meant no disrespect to you
or your daughter.

855
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,668
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

856
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,421
My name is Michael Corleone.

857
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:04,594
There are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

858
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:09,808
But then your daughter would lose a father

859
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,770
instead of gaining a husband.

860
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,155
I want to meet your daughter.

861
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:29,411
With your permission,
and under the supervision of your family.

862
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:31,746
With all respect.

863
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:41,798
<Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.>

864
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:48,805
<What's her name?>

865
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,207
<...this is my daughter, Apollonia...>

866
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:53,379
<and this is Michael Corleone.>

867
01:45:10,009 --> 01:45:10,929
<Thank you.>

868
01:45:12,604 --> 01:45:13,750
<You're welcome.>

869
01:45:24,756 --> 01:45:26,737
<What's the problem with your eye?>

870
01:45:26,821 --> 01:45:28,175
<No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.>

871
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:46,316
<I'll knock you dizzy.>

872
01:46:52,073 --> 01:46:54,157
Save it for the library.

873
01:46:57,828 --> 01:47:00,497
We've got to pick up my sister.

874
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:24,521
What's the matter?

875
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:28,233
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

876
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:31,486
It was my fault. I hit him.

877
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:35,365
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

878
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:43,873
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

879
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:46,459
Sonny, please don't do anything.

880
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,505
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

881
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:53,466
Make that baby an orphan before he's born?

882
01:47:58,013 --> 01:48:01,224
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

883
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,977
Tell them to stop taking in action.

884
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:06,521
We lost enough money last week.

885
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:15,697
Come here, come here!

886
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,965
If you touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

887
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:13,453
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

888
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:17,874
Yes, I have.
I've tried writing and calling.

889
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:21,794
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

890
01:53:21,879 --> 01:53:24,422
All we know is that he's all right.

891
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:30,595
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

892
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:35,850
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

893
01:53:37,394 --> 01:53:42,565
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

894
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:45,443
He'll get in touch with you.

895
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,238
I let my cab go,
so can I call another one, please?

896
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:51,199
Come on. Sorry.

897
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:13,095
- Hello?
~- Is Carlo there?~

898
01:54:13,889 --> 01:54:16,349
- Who is this?
~- A friend of Carlo.~

899
01:54:16,433 --> 01:54:19,810
~Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.~

900
01:54:25,567 --> 01:54:26,817
Bitch!

901
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,614
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

902
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:35,034
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

903
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:38,696
- You just told me to make you dinner!
<- Vafangool!>
[Go fuck yourself]

904
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:40,831
I'll <vafangool> you!

905
01:54:45,671 --> 01:54:48,464
She has a filthy mouth, this "Guinea" brat.

906
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:57,139
That's it, break it all,
you spoiled "Guinea" brat. Break it all!

907
01:55:06,358 --> 01:55:09,485
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

908
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:12,154
Maybe I will.

909
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:22,081
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

910
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:26,085
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

911
01:55:26,169 --> 01:55:30,673
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

912
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:35,595
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

913
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:40,558
Clean it!

914
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:44,895
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

915
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,441
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

916
01:55:48,525 --> 01:55:50,234
Come on, kill me!

917
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:53,446
Get out of here!

918
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:56,949
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

919
01:55:57,034 --> 01:55:59,702
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

920
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:13,132
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

921
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:17,303
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

922
01:56:17,387 --> 01:56:20,306
Santino, I can't understand. I don't know.

923
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,392
Yeah, Connie.

924
01:56:28,065 --> 01:56:30,024
You wait there.

925
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:35,196
No, you just wait there.

926
01:56:37,366 --> 01:56:39,617
Son of a bitch.

927
01:56:39,701 --> 01:56:42,912
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

928
01:56:47,084 --> 01:56:50,169
Open the goddamn gate! Get off your ass.

929
01:56:58,178 --> 01:56:59,428
Sonny!

930
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:07,895
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

931
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:10,856
Go after him, go on!

932
01:57:40,595 --> 01:57:42,638
Son of a bitch. Come on!

933
01:59:31,331 --> 01:59:33,165
Give me a drop.

934
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:43,884
My wife is crying upstairs.

935
01:59:46,263 --> 01:59:48,764
I hear cars coming to the house.

936
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:56,355
<Consigliere> of mine,

937
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:59,942
tell your Don what everyone seems to know.

938
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:02,403
I didn't tell Mama anything.

939
02:00:03,363 --> 02:00:06,615
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

940
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:12,329
But you needed a drink first.

941
02:00:14,666 --> 02:00:15,916
Yeah.

942
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:21,714
Well, now you've had your drink.

943
02:00:27,262 --> 02:00:31,140
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

944
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:50,743
I want no inquiries made.

945
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:57,750
I want no acts of vengeance.

946
02:00:59,461 --> 02:01:02,296
I want you to arrange a meeting

947
02:01:03,298 --> 02:01:05,925
with the heads of the five families.

948
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:09,929
This war stops now.

949
02:01:31,868 --> 02:01:34,411
Call Bonasera.

950
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:36,664
I need him now.

951
02:01:49,052 --> 02:01:50,382
~This is Tom Hagen.~

952
02:01:50,416 --> 02:01:54,256
~I'm calling for Vito Corleone,
at his request.~

953
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:56,684
~You owe your Don a service.~

954
02:01:56,768 --> 02:02:00,312
~He has no doubt that you will repay it.~

955
02:02:00,397 --> 02:02:03,151
~He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour.~

956
02:02:03,185 --> 02:02:04,766
~Be there to greet him.~

957
02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:30,718
Well, my friend,
are you ready to do me this service?

958
02:02:30,802 --> 02:02:33,887
Yes. What do you want me to do?

959
02:02:42,272 --> 02:02:46,734
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

960
02:02:50,905 --> 02:02:53,824
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

961
02:03:09,841 --> 02:03:12,968
Look how they massacred my boy.

962
02:03:41,998 --> 02:03:45,250
<It's safer to teach you English!>

963
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:47,419
<I know English...>

964
02:03:47,504 --> 02:03:52,299
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday,
Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

965
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:01,308
<Greetings, Don Tommasino.>

966
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:04,019
<How are things in Palermo?>

967
02:04:10,026 --> 02:04:14,071
<Michael is teaching me to drive...
Watch, I'll show you.>

968
02:04:16,866 --> 02:04:18,700
<How are things in Palermo?i>

969
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:22,204
<Young people don't respect
anything anymore...>

970
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:26,667
<Times are changing for the worse.>

971
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:32,339
<This place has become
too dangerous for you.>

972
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:40,222
<I want you to move
to a villa near Siracusa... Right now.>

973
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:47,396
<What's wrong?>

974
02:04:48,523 --> 02:04:50,732
<Bad news from America.>

975
02:04:53,194 --> 02:04:56,905
<Your brother, Santino, they killed him.>

976
02:05:01,629 --> 02:05:03,296
<Come on. Let's go.>

977
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:05,330
<Let's go... you promised.>

978
02:05:24,142 --> 02:05:25,142
<Fabrizio!i>

979
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:26,643
<Get the car.>

980
02:05:28,021 --> 02:05:32,191
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

981
02:05:32,275 --> 02:05:35,861
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

982
02:05:35,945 --> 02:05:37,863
Okay, anything you say.

983
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:45,537
<Calo, where is Apollonia?>

984
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:49,791
<She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.>

985
02:05:52,086 --> 02:05:54,129
<She'll make a good American wife.>

986
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:58,133
<Wait, I'll get the baggage.>

987
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:10,562
<Fabrizio!>

988
02:06:10,647 --> 02:06:12,314
<Where are you going?>

989
02:06:14,025 --> 02:06:16,443
<Wait there! I'll drive to you.>

990
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:23,992
<No, Apollonia!>

991
02:06:47,058 --> 02:06:52,896
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

992
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:57,859
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

993
02:06:59,612 --> 02:07:02,739
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

994
02:07:02,824 --> 02:07:06,159
and from Brooklyn

995
02:07:07,787 --> 02:07:09,871
Philip Tattaglia.

996
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:14,376
And from Staten Island

997
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,963
we have with us Victor Strachi.

998
02:07:18,047 --> 02:07:23,677
And the other associates that came
as far as from California and Kansas City

999
02:07:23,761 --> 02:07:26,576
and all the other
territories of the country.

1000
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:27,547
Thank you.

1001
02:07:34,355 --> 02:07:37,816
How did things ever get so far?

1002
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,526
I don't know.

1003
02:07:41,571 --> 02:07:45,073
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

1004
02:07:48,202 --> 02:07:51,621
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

1005
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:57,502
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

1006
02:07:57,587 --> 02:08:01,590
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

1007
02:08:03,051 --> 02:08:06,678
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1008
02:08:06,763 --> 02:08:12,142
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

1009
02:08:12,226 --> 02:08:16,313
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

1010
02:08:16,397 --> 02:08:20,609
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

1011
02:08:20,693 --> 02:08:23,570
He refused to share them.

1012
02:08:23,654 --> 02:08:27,449
When did I ever refuse an accommodation?

1013
02:08:27,533 --> 02:08:29,910
All of you know me.

1014
02:08:30,828 --> 02:08:35,999
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

1015
02:08:37,668 --> 02:08:43,507
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1016
02:08:43,591 --> 02:08:47,844
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1017
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:53,892
which is something that most people want,
but is forbidden by the Church.

1018
02:08:54,018 --> 02:08:58,730
Even the police that have helped us
in the past with gambling and other things

1019
02:08:58,815 --> 02:09:03,026
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1020
02:09:03,111 --> 02:09:08,240
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

1021
02:09:08,324 --> 02:09:10,534
Times have changed.

1022
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:15,372
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1023
02:09:15,456 --> 02:09:18,333
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1024
02:09:18,418 --> 02:09:21,942
If Don Corleone had all
the judges and politicians,

1025
02:09:21,976 --> 02:09:23,872
then he must share them

1026
02:09:23,923 --> 02:09:25,368
or let others use them.

1027
02:09:25,402 --> 02:09:28,543
He must let us draw the water
from the well.

1028
02:09:29,595 --> 02:09:33,181
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1029
02:09:33,266 --> 02:09:35,851
After all, we're not communists.

1030
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:42,065
I also don't believe in drugs.

1031
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:47,028
For years I paid my people extra,
so they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1032
02:09:47,113 --> 02:09:50,240
Somebody says to them "I have powders."

1033
02:09:50,324 --> 02:09:53,577
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,

1034
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:56,663
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1035
02:09:57,874 --> 02:09:59,354
They can't resist.

1036
02:09:59,388 --> 02:10:03,828
I want to control it as a business,
keep it respectable.

1037
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:08,675
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1038
02:10:08,759 --> 02:10:10,552
That's an <infàmia>.
[Infamy]

1039
02:10:11,888 --> 02:10:15,807
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1040
02:10:15,892 --> 02:10:19,102
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1041
02:10:25,735 --> 02:10:29,321
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1042
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:37,370
And I'm willing to do whatever is necessary
to find a peaceful solution.

1043
02:10:37,914 --> 02:10:39,061
We are agreed.

1044
02:10:39,095 --> 02:10:42,534
The traffic in drugs will be permitted,
but controlled.

1045
02:10:42,585 --> 02:10:45,303
Don Corleone will give us
protection in the east,

1046
02:10:45,337 --> 02:10:46,913
and there will be peace.

1047
02:10:46,964 --> 02:10:50,717
I must have strict assurance from Corleone.

1048
02:10:50,801 --> 02:10:54,095
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

1049
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:56,848
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1050
02:10:56,933 --> 02:11:02,062
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1051
02:11:02,146 --> 02:11:05,023
You talk about vengeance.

1052
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:08,360
Will vengeance bring your son back to you?

1053
02:11:08,444 --> 02:11:10,987
Or my boy to me?

1054
02:11:11,072 --> 02:11:13,865
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1055
02:11:16,661 --> 02:11:18,954
But I have selfish reasons.

1056
02:11:21,249 --> 02:11:24,834
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1057
02:11:26,712 --> 02:11:29,256
because of this Sollozzo business.

1058
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,719
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1059
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:37,472
Cleared of all these false charges.

1060
02:11:38,891 --> 02:11:42,018
But I'm a superstitious man.

1061
02:11:42,144 --> 02:11:47,440
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

1062
02:11:48,818 --> 02:11:52,404
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1063
02:11:52,488 --> 02:11:55,365
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1064
02:11:56,659 --> 02:12:00,245
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1065
02:12:01,914 --> 02:12:04,249
And that I do not forgive.

1066
02:12:06,711 --> 02:12:09,087
But, that aside

1067
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:14,509
let me say that I swear

1068
02:12:16,137 --> 02:12:19,264
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1069
02:12:19,348 --> 02:12:23,727
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1070
02:12:49,211 --> 02:12:53,014
Should I insist that all of
Tattaglia's drug middlemen

1071
02:12:53,048 --> 02:12:54,707
have clean records?

1072
02:12:54,759 --> 02:12:56,885
Mention it. Don't insist.

1073
02:12:58,888 --> 02:13:03,808
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1074
02:13:05,436 --> 02:13:07,395
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1075
02:13:08,481 --> 02:13:11,608
He could never have outfought Santino.

1076
02:13:13,986 --> 02:13:19,574
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1077
02:13:35,049 --> 02:13:37,133
Come on, Nancy.

1078
02:13:38,344 --> 02:13:40,929
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1079
02:13:42,264 --> 02:13:43,932
Okay, all right.

1080
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:59,239
How long have you been back?

1081
02:14:00,032 --> 02:14:01,866
I've been back a year.

1082
02:14:03,285 --> 02:14:05,412
Longer than that, I think.

1083
02:14:08,249 --> 02:14:10,417
It's good to see you, Kay.

1084
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:24,013
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1085
02:14:26,517 --> 02:14:29,519
He's been sick. Very sick.

1086
02:14:31,063 --> 02:14:33,022
But you're not like him.

1087
02:14:33,107 --> 02:14:36,901
You told me you weren't going
to become like your father.

1088
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:43,116
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1089
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,661
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1090
02:14:47,872 --> 02:14:50,290
Like a senator or president.

1091
02:14:50,374 --> 02:14:52,834
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1092
02:14:52,918 --> 02:14:55,754
They don't have men killed.

1093
02:14:59,175 --> 02:15:01,176
Who's being naive, Kay?

1094
02:15:02,428 --> 02:15:06,681
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1095
02:15:08,225 --> 02:15:12,604
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1096
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:17,311
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1097
02:15:17,345 --> 02:15:18,434
Kay...

1098
02:15:19,862 --> 02:15:22,989
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1099
02:15:24,283 --> 02:15:27,030
What do you want with me
after all this time?

1100
02:15:27,064 --> 02:15:29,153
I've been calling and writing.

1101
02:15:29,205 --> 02:15:32,707
I came because I need you. I care for you.

1102
02:15:32,792 --> 02:15:36,628
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1103
02:15:38,339 --> 02:15:40,924
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1104
02:15:42,676 --> 02:15:46,554
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1105
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:52,477
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1106
02:15:54,021 --> 02:15:57,273
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1107
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:01,569
That we have children. Our children.

1108
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:05,240
Kay, I need you.

1109
02:16:07,201 --> 02:16:08,785
And I love you.

1110
02:16:30,933 --> 02:16:34,686
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1111
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:38,439
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1112
02:16:38,524 --> 02:16:41,651
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1113
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:44,863
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1114
02:16:44,947 --> 02:16:48,408
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1115
02:16:48,492 --> 02:16:52,370
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1116
02:16:53,873 --> 02:16:56,040
Don Corleone...

1117
02:16:56,125 --> 02:17:00,253
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1118
02:17:00,337 --> 02:17:04,382
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1119
02:17:05,384 --> 02:17:08,052
Michael is now head of the family.

1120
02:17:08,137 --> 02:17:12,432
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1121
02:17:12,516 --> 02:17:14,893
After we make the move to Nevada

1122
02:17:14,977 --> 02:17:19,397
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1123
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:23,818
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1124
02:17:23,903 --> 02:17:27,155
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1125
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:30,074
me and Pete will come
under Barzini's thumb.

1126
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:31,577
I hate that Barzini.

1127
02:17:31,611 --> 02:17:35,863
In six months' time there will be
nothing left to build on.

1128
02:17:35,915 --> 02:17:38,833
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1129
02:17:38,918 --> 02:17:41,836
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1130
02:17:41,921 --> 02:17:45,173
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1131
02:17:50,095 --> 02:17:53,390
Things are negotiated
that'll solve your problems

1132
02:17:53,424 --> 02:17:55,466
and answer your questions.

1133
02:17:55,517 --> 02:17:57,852
That's all I can tell you now.

1134
02:17:58,687 --> 02:18:01,272
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1135
02:18:01,357 --> 02:18:04,734
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1136
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:09,614
Tom Hagen is no longer <consigliere>.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1137
02:18:09,698 --> 02:18:12,241
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1138
02:18:12,326 --> 02:18:13,519
If I ever need help,

1139
02:18:13,553 --> 02:18:17,071
who's a better <consigliere> than my father?
That's it.

1140
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:40,895
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1141
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:43,898
Mike... Why am I out?

1142
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:48,111
You're not a wartime <consigliere>, Tom.

1143
02:18:49,405 --> 02:18:52,657
Things may get rough with the move.

1144
02:18:52,741 --> 02:18:54,033
Tom.

1145
02:18:59,206 --> 02:19:00,595
I advised Michael.

1146
02:19:00,629 --> 02:19:04,410
I never thought you were a bad <consigliere>.

1147
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:08,589
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1148
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:13,261
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1149
02:19:14,263 --> 02:19:17,240
But there are reasons
why you must have no part

1150
02:19:17,274 --> 02:19:19,258
in what is going to happen.

1151
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:23,312
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1152
02:20:12,488 --> 02:20:16,783
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1153
02:20:16,909 --> 02:20:20,268
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it?

1154
02:20:20,302 --> 02:20:21,529
Hey, hey, hey!

1155
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:25,708
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1156
02:20:25,793 --> 02:20:28,169
Let me open the door, all right?

1157
02:20:34,343 --> 02:20:39,764
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1158
02:20:39,848 --> 02:20:42,475
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1159
02:20:46,396 --> 02:20:49,482
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1160
02:20:50,692 --> 02:20:54,195
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1161
02:20:55,614 --> 02:20:59,033
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1162
02:21:00,577 --> 02:21:05,248
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1163
02:21:05,332 --> 02:21:08,000
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1164
02:21:13,882 --> 02:21:17,176
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1165
02:21:17,261 --> 02:21:19,387
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1166
02:21:21,098 --> 02:21:23,224
Hey, come on! Scram!

1167
02:21:24,893 --> 02:21:25,779
Come on, honey.

1168
02:21:25,813 --> 02:21:28,470
I don't know what's the matter with him,
Johnny.

1169
02:21:28,522 --> 02:21:29,814
Sorry.

1170
02:21:31,775 --> 02:21:34,318
I don't know. He's tired.

1171
02:21:41,326 --> 02:21:44,412
What happened to Moe Greene?

1172
02:21:44,496 --> 02:21:45,679
He had some business.

1173
02:21:45,713 --> 02:21:48,866
He said to give him a call
when the party started.

1174
02:21:48,917 --> 02:21:50,877
Well, give him a call.

1175
02:21:52,254 --> 02:21:55,381
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1176
02:21:55,465 --> 02:21:57,675
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1177
02:21:57,759 --> 02:22:01,345
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1178
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:03,681
Well, I owe it all to him.

1179
02:22:04,892 --> 02:22:06,475
He knows how grateful you are.

1180
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:09,812
That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1181
02:22:09,897 --> 02:22:11,814
Mike, what can I do?

1182
02:22:12,983 --> 02:22:15,443
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1183
02:22:15,527 --> 02:22:18,446
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1184
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:24,619
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1185
02:22:24,703 --> 02:22:27,455
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1186
02:22:27,539 --> 02:22:30,541
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1187
02:22:30,626 --> 02:22:33,336
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1188
02:22:34,630 --> 02:22:37,048
See, Johnny...

1189
02:22:37,132 --> 02:22:41,344
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1190
02:22:41,428 --> 02:22:45,181
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1191
02:22:48,101 --> 02:22:52,730
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1192
02:22:53,982 --> 02:22:56,108
We're counting on you.

1193
02:22:58,111 --> 02:23:01,781
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1194
02:23:01,865 --> 02:23:03,157
Good.

1195
02:23:04,785 --> 02:23:09,413
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1196
02:23:09,498 --> 02:23:12,041
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1197
02:23:12,167 --> 02:23:13,439
Have everything?

1198
02:23:13,473 --> 02:23:17,288
Specially prepared food, the best dancers,
and good credit.

1199
02:23:17,339 --> 02:23:20,925
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1200
02:23:23,595 --> 02:23:26,347
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?

1201
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:29,934
Buy me out?

1202
02:23:30,018 --> 02:23:32,603
The casino, the hotel.

1203
02:23:32,688 --> 02:23:35,606
The Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1204
02:23:35,691 --> 02:23:41,112
The Corleone family wants to buy me out?
No, I buy you out.

1205
02:23:41,196 --> 02:23:44,615
Your casino loses money. We can do better.

1206
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:48,577
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1207
02:23:53,375 --> 02:23:55,793
You Guineas make me laugh.

1208
02:23:55,919 --> 02:24:00,506
I took Freddy in when you had a bad time,
and now you try to push me out!

1209
02:24:01,883 --> 02:24:05,303
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

1210
02:24:05,387 --> 02:24:08,817
and the Molinari family
guaranteed his safety.

1211
02:24:08,851 --> 02:24:10,674
Let's talk business.

1212
02:24:10,726 --> 02:24:13,477
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1213
02:24:13,562 --> 02:24:16,022
You don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

1214
02:24:16,148 --> 02:24:17,352
The Godfather is sick.

1215
02:24:17,386 --> 02:24:20,559
You're getting chased out
of New York by the others.

1216
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:24,530
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1217
02:24:24,614 --> 02:24:29,660
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1218
02:24:29,745 --> 02:24:33,247
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1219
02:24:33,332 --> 02:24:38,169
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1220
02:24:38,253 --> 02:24:42,465
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1221
02:24:42,549 --> 02:24:47,303
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1222
02:24:47,387 --> 02:24:51,265
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1223
02:24:51,350 --> 02:24:54,185
You straightened my brother out?

1224
02:24:54,269 --> 02:24:58,731
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1225
02:24:58,815 --> 02:25:00,775
What's wrong with you?

1226
02:25:05,655 --> 02:25:08,783
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1227
02:25:09,701 --> 02:25:11,327
Son of a bitch!

1228
02:25:11,411 --> 02:25:12,704
I'm Moe Greene!

1229
02:25:12,738 --> 02:25:16,615
I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1230
02:25:16,666 --> 02:25:19,168
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1231
02:25:20,295 --> 02:25:23,839
Tom, you're the <consigliere>.
Talk to the Don...

1232
02:25:23,965 --> 02:25:25,310
Just a minute.

1233
02:25:25,344 --> 02:25:29,378
Don is semi-retired and Mike is in charge
of the family business.

1234
02:25:29,429 --> 02:25:32,765
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1235
02:25:37,646 --> 02:25:42,483
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1236
02:25:43,235 --> 02:25:44,443
Fredo...

1237
02:25:45,654 --> 02:25:48,406
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1238
02:25:49,866 --> 02:25:53,869
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1239
02:25:55,372 --> 02:25:56,372
Ever.

1240
02:26:04,506 --> 02:26:08,676
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1241
02:26:10,429 --> 02:26:11,995
This weekend we'll go out.

1242
02:26:12,029 --> 02:26:15,340
We'll go to the city,
see a show and have dinner.

1243
02:26:22,691 --> 02:26:25,734
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1244
02:26:25,819 --> 02:26:27,945
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1245
02:26:28,029 --> 02:26:30,990
They want you to be godfather to their boy.

1246
02:26:31,074 --> 02:26:32,908
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1247
02:26:32,993 --> 02:26:35,327
Let me think about it. Come on.

1248
02:26:44,212 --> 02:26:47,089
Barzini will move against you first.

1249
02:26:47,174 --> 02:26:51,594
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1250
02:26:51,678 --> 02:26:53,721
Guaranteeing your safety.

1251
02:26:54,973 --> 02:26:58,058
And at that meeting you'll be assassinated.

1252
02:27:02,772 --> 02:27:05,774
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1253
02:27:07,194 --> 02:27:10,696
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1254
02:27:15,744 --> 02:27:17,244
I don't know.

1255
02:27:19,289 --> 02:27:22,208
Are you happy with your wife and children?

1256
02:27:23,168 --> 02:27:26,003
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1257
02:27:27,881 --> 02:27:32,760
I hope you don't mind the way
I keep going over this Barzini business.

1258
02:27:32,844 --> 02:27:35,804
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1259
02:27:37,265 --> 02:27:40,267
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1260
02:27:41,811 --> 02:27:45,272
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1261
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:50,945
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1262
02:27:51,071 --> 02:27:53,781
He looks more like you every day.

1263
02:27:56,493 --> 02:28:00,955
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1264
02:28:03,083 --> 02:28:05,125
Read the funny papers.

1265
02:28:12,342 --> 02:28:17,972
I want you to arrange for a telephone man
to check all in-and out-going calls.

1266
02:28:18,098 --> 02:28:21,334
I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.

1267
02:28:21,368 --> 02:28:23,427
That's right. I forgot.

1268
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:29,149
What's the matter?

1269
02:28:29,985 --> 02:28:32,027
What's bothering you?

1270
02:28:35,615 --> 02:28:40,244
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1271
02:28:53,508 --> 02:28:58,012
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1272
02:28:58,096 --> 02:28:59,722
And Fredo...

1273
02:29:02,434 --> 02:29:04,476
Fredo was, well...

1274
02:29:06,354 --> 02:29:09,189
But I never wanted this for you.

1275
02:29:11,526 --> 02:29:13,053
I worked my whole life.

1276
02:29:13,087 --> 02:29:16,605
I don't apologize for
taking care of my family.

1277
02:29:16,656 --> 02:29:20,576
And I refused to be a fool,

1278
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:24,788
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1279
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:30,210
I don't apologize.
That's my life, but I thought that,

1280
02:29:31,880 --> 02:29:37,051
that when it was your time, you would be
the one to hold the strings.

1281
02:29:38,845 --> 02:29:44,516
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1282
02:29:44,601 --> 02:29:47,603
Another <pezzonovante>.
[Big Shot]

1283
02:29:47,687 --> 02:29:49,355
Well...

1284
02:29:52,567 --> 02:29:56,487
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1285
02:29:56,571 --> 02:30:00,074
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1286
02:30:04,913 --> 02:30:09,375
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1287
02:30:09,459 --> 02:30:12,419
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1288
02:30:29,396 --> 02:30:31,522
Can I hold it, please?

1289
02:30:46,621 --> 02:30:50,499
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1290
02:30:50,583 --> 02:30:53,377
Over here, over here.

1291
02:30:55,255 --> 02:30:57,756
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1292
02:31:04,139 --> 02:31:05,889
Anthony!

1293
02:31:05,974 --> 02:31:07,641
Come here, come here.

1294
02:31:12,814 --> 02:31:15,482
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1295
02:31:20,697 --> 02:31:23,282
I'll show you something. Come here.

1296
02:31:25,326 --> 02:31:27,202
Stand there.

1297
02:31:30,957 --> 02:31:32,708
Give me an orange!

1298
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:52,853
That's a new trick.

1299
02:31:53,855 --> 02:31:56,190
You run in there. Run in there.

1300
02:32:09,746 --> 02:32:11,705
Where are you?

1301
02:35:09,384 --> 02:35:11,760
Mike, can I have a minute?

1302
02:35:21,854 --> 02:35:24,314
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1303
02:35:24,399 --> 02:35:27,693
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1304
02:35:28,361 --> 02:35:30,570
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1305
02:35:31,906 --> 02:35:35,701
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1306
02:35:38,746 --> 02:35:41,289
- All right?
- All right.

1307
02:35:58,808 --> 02:36:01,768
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1308
02:36:04,272 --> 02:36:07,941
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.
Tessio's ground.

1309
02:36:10,111 --> 02:36:11,903
Where I'll be safe.

1310
02:36:24,167 --> 02:36:27,753
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

1311
02:36:27,837 --> 02:36:31,631
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1312
02:36:33,885 --> 02:36:35,177
But I'm going to wait.

1313
02:36:35,845 --> 02:36:36,845
After the baptism.

1314
02:36:40,725 --> 02:36:44,311
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1315
02:36:44,395 --> 02:36:48,565
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini
and Tattaglia.

1316
02:36:50,151 --> 02:36:53,111
All the heads of the five families.

1317
02:39:14,086 --> 02:39:19,049
«Michael, do you believe in God, the Father,
Creator of Heaven and Earth?»

1318
02:39:19,133 --> 02:39:20,300
I do.

1319
02:39:20,384 --> 02:39:23,887
«Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?»

1320
02:39:23,971 --> 02:39:24,971
«I do.»

1321
02:39:25,056 --> 02:39:29,100
«Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?»

1322
02:39:29,185 --> 02:39:30,477
«I do.»

1323
02:40:36,043 --> 02:40:40,380
«Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?»

1324
02:40:46,637 --> 02:40:47,887
I do renounce him.

1325
02:40:57,565 --> 02:40:58,982
«And all his works?»

1326
02:41:12,872 --> 02:41:13,913
I do renounce them.

1327
02:41:15,666 --> 02:41:16,916
Oh, God!

1328
02:41:19,837 --> 02:41:23,506
«- And all his pomps?»
- I do renounce them.

1329
02:41:39,273 --> 02:41:43,485
«Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?»

1330
02:41:43,569 --> 02:41:44,778
I will.

1331
02:41:51,911 --> 02:41:57,415
«Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.»

1332
02:42:11,639 --> 02:42:13,556
Kay!

1333
02:42:13,641 --> 02:42:15,600
Kiss your godfather.

1334
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,087
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come up.

1335
02:42:44,171 --> 02:42:45,839
Everybody has to leave without us.

1336
02:42:45,923 --> 02:42:48,883
«- Mike, it's our first vacation!»
- Connie, please.

1337
02:42:49,009 --> 02:42:52,512
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1338
02:42:53,639 --> 02:42:56,015
I'll only be a couple of days.

1339
02:43:12,283 --> 02:43:14,492
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1340
02:43:16,662 --> 02:43:20,415
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1341
02:43:28,215 --> 02:43:31,785
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come
in a separate car,

1342
02:43:31,819 --> 02:43:33,669
so you two go on ahead.

1343
02:43:33,721 --> 02:43:37,265
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1344
02:43:37,349 --> 02:43:39,517
I can't go either, Sal.

1345
02:43:51,489 --> 02:43:55,408
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1346
02:43:57,077 --> 02:43:59,913
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1347
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:08,379
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1348
02:44:09,548 --> 02:44:12,717
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1349
02:44:58,138 --> 02:45:00,974
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1350
02:45:05,854 --> 02:45:09,774
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1351
02:45:10,818 --> 02:45:14,737
That little farce you played with
my sister.

1352
02:45:14,822 --> 02:45:19,909
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1353
02:45:19,994 --> 02:45:22,704
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1354
02:45:25,374 --> 02:45:27,667
Don't do this to me, please.

1355
02:45:36,927 --> 02:45:38,678
Barzini is dead.

1356
02:45:40,806 --> 02:45:43,141
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1357
02:45:44,351 --> 02:45:45,852
Moe Greene.

1358
02:45:46,812 --> 02:45:50,607
Strachi. Cuneo.

1359
02:45:52,568 --> 02:45:57,822
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1360
02:45:57,906 --> 02:45:59,699
Admit what you did.

1361
02:46:03,621 --> 02:46:05,288
Get him a drink.

1362
02:46:11,587 --> 02:46:12,879
Come on.

1363
02:46:14,214 --> 02:46:16,633
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1364
02:46:16,717 --> 02:46:19,594
Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?

1365
02:46:20,721 --> 02:46:23,431
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1366
02:46:30,356 --> 02:46:32,398
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1367
02:46:37,196 --> 02:46:41,032
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1368
02:46:42,117 --> 02:46:46,079
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1369
02:46:46,163 --> 02:46:47,789
Tom.

1370
02:46:51,919 --> 02:46:55,505
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1371
02:46:55,589 --> 02:46:58,174
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1372
02:46:59,426 --> 02:47:03,680
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1373
02:47:07,935 --> 02:47:09,977
Who approached you?

1374
02:47:11,271 --> 02:47:13,481
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1375
02:47:21,365 --> 02:47:23,074
It was Barzini.

1376
02:47:27,204 --> 02:47:28,788
Good.

1377
02:47:35,003 --> 02:47:39,048
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1378
02:47:39,133 --> 02:47:42,677
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

1379
02:47:46,974 --> 02:47:49,517
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1380
02:48:15,669 --> 02:48:17,295
Hello, Carlo.

1381
02:49:17,147 --> 02:49:20,274
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1382
02:49:28,659 --> 02:49:30,743
Michael!

1383
02:49:30,828 --> 02:49:32,829
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1384
02:49:35,249 --> 02:49:40,378
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1385
02:49:40,462 --> 02:49:44,549
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1386
02:49:44,633 --> 02:49:47,718
You blamed him for Sonny. Everybody did.

1387
02:49:47,803 --> 02:49:53,599
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1388
02:49:53,684 --> 02:49:55,309
Connie.

1389
02:49:57,563 --> 02:50:00,273
Why do you think he kept Carlo
at the Mall?

1390
02:50:00,357 --> 02:50:03,192
He knew he was going to kill him.

1391
02:50:03,277 --> 02:50:08,614
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1392
02:50:08,699 --> 02:50:11,610
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1393
02:50:11,644 --> 02:50:12,818
Read the papers!

1394
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:15,621
That's your husband, that's your husband!

1395
02:50:25,299 --> 02:50:29,510
No! No, no...

1396
02:50:29,595 --> 02:50:32,972
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1397
02:50:54,119 --> 02:50:55,828
She's hysterical.

1398
02:51:00,375 --> 02:51:02,126
Hysterical.

1399
02:51:04,129 --> 02:51:05,838
Michael, is it true?

1400
02:51:07,841 --> 02:51:11,510
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1401
02:51:11,595 --> 02:51:14,347
Don't ask me about my business. Enough!

1402
02:51:34,409 --> 02:51:35,910
All right.

1403
02:51:38,747 --> 02:51:40,498
This one time.

1404
02:51:44,461 --> 02:51:47,797
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

1405
02:51:53,887 --> 02:51:55,304
Is it true?

1406
02:51:59,393 --> 02:52:00,893
Is it?

1407
02:52:02,646 --> 02:52:04,021
No.

1408
02:52:17,953 --> 02:52:20,913
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1409
02:52:52,195 --> 02:52:53,904
Don Corleone.
