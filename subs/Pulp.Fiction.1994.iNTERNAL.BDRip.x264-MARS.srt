1
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:34,193
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,735
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,738
I'm through, never again, too dangerous.

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,070
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,804
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,676
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,182
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,151
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,687
Quack, quack, quack.

10
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,848
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:56,924 --> 00:01:00,382
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're
never gonna have to hear me quack.

12
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,725
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

13
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,098
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

14
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,497
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,537
I mean, the way it is now, you're takin'
the same risk as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,676
Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,545
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:28,054
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,420
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,551
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says...

21
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:38,257
We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give
him all your money, we're gonna kill her.

22
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,128
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.

23
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,896
That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead
walks into a bank with a telephone.

24
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,065
Not a pistol, not a shotgun,
a fuckin' phone.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,540
Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.

26
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,737
Did they hurt the little girl?

27
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,543
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

28
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,585
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

29
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,621
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

30
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,122
I'm just illustrating if we did,
it'd be easier than what we've been doing.

31
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,555
No more liquor stores?

32
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,390
What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

33
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,431
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

34
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,762
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

35
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,166
You tell 'em empty out the register,
they don't know what you're talkin' about.

36
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,759
They make it too personal.

37
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,772
We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,469
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- I don't want to kill anybody either.

39
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,512
But they'll probably put us in
a situation where it's us or them.

40
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,137
And if it's not the gooks...

41
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,240
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

42
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,755
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,756
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,758
See how far that gets you. Forget it.

45
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,761
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

46
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,854
- Not in this life.
- What then?

47
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,195
Garcon, coffee!

48
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,963
This place.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,940
Garcon means boy.

50
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,041
This place? A coffee shop?

51
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,707
What's wrong with that?

52
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,848
Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?

53
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,223
Bars, liquor stores...

54
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,022
gas stations... you get your head blown off
stickin' up one of them.

55
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,530
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

56
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,000
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

57
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,029
I bet you could cut down
on the hero factor in a place like this.

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,129
Correct.

59
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,473
Same as banks, these places are insured.

60
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,877
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

61
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,813
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

62
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,842
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

63
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,856
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

64
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,415
really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner?

65
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,586
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

66
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,323
One minute,
they're havin' a Denver omelet...

67
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,367
the next minute, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

68
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:59,497
See, I got the idea the last liquor store
we stuck up, remember?

69
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,235
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:06,176
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

71
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,440
Thank you.

72
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,606
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

73
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,014
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

74
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,677
A lot of wallets.

75
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,745
Pretty smart, huh?

76
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,852
Pretty smart.

77
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,392
I'm ready, let's do it,
right now, right here.

78
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,956
- Come on.
- All right. Same as last time, remember?

79
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,797
You're crowd control,
I'll handle the employees.

80
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,239
- I love you, pumpkin.
- I love you, honey bunny.

81
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,914
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

82
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,883
Any of you fucking pricks move...

83
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,751
and I'll execute every motherfuckin'
last one of you.

84
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,562
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie</i>

85
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,830
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Get it on</i>

86
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,066
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie</i>

87
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,368
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Get it on</i>

88
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,706
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie</i>

89
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,871
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down</i>

90
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,211
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Get down and boogie</i>

91
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,774
<i>- Jungle boogie
- Shake it around</i>

92
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,355
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,228
- Hash is legal there, right?
- Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

94
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,930
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

95
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,371
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

96
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,069
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah, it breaks down like this.

97
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,476
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

98
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,742
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, its legal to sell it.

99
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:34,253
It's illegal to carry it, but that
doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

100
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,758
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

101
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,157
I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.

102
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,890
Oh, man! I'm goin'.
That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

103
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,058
I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,459
But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?

105
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,834
- What?
- It's the little differences.

106
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,169
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here.

107
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,267
- But it's just there, it's a little different.
- Example.

108
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:02,008
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

109
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,744
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

110
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,686
And in Paris, you can buy a beer
in McDonald's.

111
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,191
You know what they call
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

112
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,454
They don't call it
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

113
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,326
They got the metric system. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.

114
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,299
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

115
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,303
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

116
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,838
What do they call a Big Mac?

117
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,204
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

118
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,867
Le Big Mac.

119
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,002
What do they call a Whopper?

120
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,514
I don't know. I didn't go
into Burger King.

121
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,210
You know what they put on french fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?

122
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,308
What?

123
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:43,220
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

124
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,951
I seen 'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.

125
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,197
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

126
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,333
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

127
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:03,001
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

128
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,670
So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?

129
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,908
- It's possible.
- We should have fuckin' shotguns.

130
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,643
- What's her name?
- Mia.

131
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,882
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

132
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,550
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

133
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,150
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

134
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,890
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

135
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,659
Pilot? What's a pilot?

136
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,225
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

137
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,703
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television...

138
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,037
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

139
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,098
Yeah.

140
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,579
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

141
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,275
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

142
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,581
and on the strength of that one show, they
decide if they wanna make more shows.

143
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:52,283
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

144
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,450
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

145
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,294
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

146
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,232
Half-black, half-Samoan,
used to call him Tony Rocky Horror.

147
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,769
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

148
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,701
I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.

149
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,570
He got a weight problem. I mean, what's
a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

150
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,700
I think I know who you mean.
What about him?

151
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,075
Marsellus fucked him up good.

152
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:17,412
Word 'round the campfire is it was on
account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

153
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,585
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

154
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,154
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

155
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,730
A foot massage?
That's it?

156
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,973
Then what'd Marsellus do?

157
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,238
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

158
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,247
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

159
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,342
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

160
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,683
Nigger fell through that.

161
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,689
Since then, he kind of developed
a speech impediment.

162
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,789
That's a damn shame.

163
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,660
But still I have to say, you play
with matches, you get burned.

164
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,260
What do you mean?

165
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,637
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

166
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,176
You don't think he overreacted?

167
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,147
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the
way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

168
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:27,346
It was a foot message. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

169
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,980
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

170
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,960
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?
No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

171
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,519
Stop right there.

172
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,793
Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot
massage ain't even the same fucking thing.

173
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,803
- It's not, it's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

174
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,806
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

175
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,640
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies...

176
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,977
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the
same league, it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

177
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,917
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

178
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,523
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
I'm the foot fuckin' master.

179
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,081
You given a lot of them?

180
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:10,094
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

181
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,562
Would you give a guy a foot massage?

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,867
Fuck you.

183
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,096
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

184
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,902
You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage myself.

185
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,876
Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

186
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,873
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

187
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,677
What time you got?

188
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,948
7:22 in the A.M.

189
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,618
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

190
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,935
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no
man a foot massage don't make it right...

191
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,236
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off
a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...

192
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,039
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks,
that shit ain't right.

193
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,310
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

194
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:08,376
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot
massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

195
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:13,084
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

196
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,890
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

197
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,056
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

198
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,329
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

199
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:27,463
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

200
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,942
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man
with a sense of humor about this shit.

201
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,638
You know what I'm sayin'?

202
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,814
It's an interestin' point.

203
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,850
Come on. Let's get into character.

204
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,783
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

205
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,852
- Mia.
- Why you so interested in big man's wife?

206
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:56,162
He's goin' out of town, Florida, and he asked
me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

207
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:00,205
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

208
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,639
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

209
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,270
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

210
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,974
It is not a date.

211
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:13,144
It's just like if you were gonna take
your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

212
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,449
It's just good company, that's all.

213
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,458
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

214
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,738
Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?

215
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,503
Hey, keep chillin'.

216
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,474
You know who we are?

217
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,512
We're associates of your business partner,
Marsellus Wallace.

218
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,583
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

219
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,061
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

220
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,330
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

221
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,168
I thought so.

222
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,869
You remember your business partner
Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?

223
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,378
Yeah, I remember.

224
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:17,746
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

225
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,444
Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?

226
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,515
Hamburgers.

227
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,684
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

228
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,085
What kind of hamburgers?

229
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,125
- Cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

230
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,291
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box?

231
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,199
- Where?
- Big Kahuna Burger.

232
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,399
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

233
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:45,433
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself. How are they?

234
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,639
- They're good.
- You mind if I try one of yours?

235
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,384
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

236
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,657
This is a tasty burger! Vincent!

237
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,291
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?

238
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,795
- Want a bite? They're real tasty.
- I ain't hungry.

239
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,306
Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

240
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,243
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...

241
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,441
which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.

242
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,076
But I do love the taste
of a good burger.

243
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,753
You know what they call
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?

244
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,416
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

245
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,486
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

246
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,531
You know why they call it that?

247
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,202
Because of the metric system?

248
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,536
Check out the big brain on Brett!

249
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:52,008
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

250
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,440
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

251
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,847
Sprite. Good.

252
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,387
You mind if I have some of your tasty
beverage to wash this down with?

253
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,645
Go right ahead.

254
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,230
That hit the spot.

255
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,732
You, Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

256
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,011
Why don't you tell my man Vince here
where you got the shit hid at.

257
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,340
It's over there...

258
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,042
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

259
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,517
You were sayin'?

260
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,648
It's in the cupboard.

261
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,861
No, the one by your knees.

262
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,774
We happy?

263
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,520
Vincent?

264
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,286
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

265
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,627
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't get your name.

266
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,895
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
But I never got yours.

267
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:26,700
My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't
talkin' your way outta this shit.

268
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,296
No, no, no.

269
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,243
I just want you to know how...

270
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,873
I just want you to know how sorry we are
that things got so fucked up...

271
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,112
with us and Mr. Wallace.

272
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,714
We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really, I never...

273
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,158
Oh, I'm sorry, did I break
your concentration?

274
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,820
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

275
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:57,130
Continue. You were saying something
about best intentions.

276
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,406
What's the matter? Oh, you were finished!

277
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,171
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

278
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,740
What does Marsellus Wallace look like?

279
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,012
What?

280
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,320
- What country you from?
- What?

281
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,187
What ain't no country I ever heard of.
They speak English in what?

282
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,657
What?

283
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,457
- English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?
- Yes!

284
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,191
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

285
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,699
Describe what
Marsellus Wallace looks like!

286
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,426
- What? I...
- Say what again!

287
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,441
Say what again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

288
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,377
- Say what one more goddamn time!
- He's black.

289
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,811
- Go on!
- He's bald!

290
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,612
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

291
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,346
Does he look like a bitch?

292
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,446
No!

293
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,652
Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?

294
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:58,356
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

295
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,625
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

296
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,967
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

297
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,064
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

298
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:13,703
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sort of fits this occasion.

299
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,145
Ezekiel 25:17.

300
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,517
The path of the righteous man...

301
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,521
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

302
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,524
and the tyranny of evil men.

303
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:31,529
Blessed is he who
in the name of charity and goodwill...

304
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,725
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness...

305
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,496
for he is truly his brother's keeper...

306
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,097
and the finder of lost children.

307
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:47,043
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance and furious anger...

308
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:51,743
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers!

309
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,685
And you will know my name is the Lord...

310
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,122
when I lay my vengeance upon thee!

311
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:22,075
I think you gonna find,
when all this shit is over and done...

312
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,942
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

313
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,879
The thing is, Butch...

314
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,285
right now you got ability.

315
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:43,333
But painful as it may be,
ability don't last.

316
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,936
And your days are just about over.

317
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,835
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

318
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,977
But that's a fact of life your ass is
gonna have to get realistic about.

319
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:05,351
You see, this business is filled to the brim
with unrealistic motherfuckers.

320
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:10,685
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

321
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,130
If you mean it turns
to vinegar, it does.

322
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,169
If you mean it gets better
with age, it don't.

323
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,799
Besides, Butch...

324
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,640
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

325
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,282
Two?

326
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,785
Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.

327
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,551
You came close, but you never made it.

328
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,327
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

329
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,314
You my nigger?

330
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,516
Certainly appears so.

331
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,201
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

332
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,274
That's pride fuckin' with you.

333
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,938
Fuck pride!

334
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,945
Pride only hurts.

335
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,220
It never helps.

336
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,681
You fight through that shit.

337
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:52,061
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...

338
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:56,625
you gonna say to yourself,
Marsellus Wallace was right.

339
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,133
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.

340
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:07,275
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

341
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,716
Say it.

342
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,784
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

343
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,417
Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.

344
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:27,955
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

345
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,297
Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes?

346
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,892
You don't even want to know.

347
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,236
Where's the big man?

348
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,071
The big man's right over
there takin' care of some business.

349
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,773
Why don't you hang back for a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, just go on over.

350
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,743
How ya been?

351
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,913
I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?

352
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,752
All right.

353
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,187
So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.

354
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,094
At Marsellus's request.

355
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,369
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

356
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,633
What's so fuckin' funny?

357
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,301
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

358
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:15,643
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?
It's the big man's wife.

359
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,376
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed...

360
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,452
laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.

361
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,647
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

362
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,522
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for, asshole?

363
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,797
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

364
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,303
No.

365
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,042
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

366
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:52,139
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

367
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,811
Vincent Vega's in the house?

368
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,856
My nigger, get your ass over here.

369
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,528
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

370
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,761
You shouldn't worry about it.

371
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,838
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

372
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,865
And some matches.

373
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,213
Thanks.

374
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,884
It's as if it turns every part of
your body into the tip of a penis.

375
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,254
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

376
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:38,352
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't
use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

377
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,264
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

378
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:47,236
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

379
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:50,764
Five in each ear, one through the nipple
of my left breast...

380
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,970
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow...

381
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,912
one in my belly, one in my lip,
one in my clit...

382
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,440
- And I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

383
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,452
I was just curious...

384
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,422
but why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

385
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,950
Sex thing. Helps fellatio.

386
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:13,554
Vincenzo. Step in my office.

387
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,832
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

388
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,343
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

389
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,347
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

390
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:34,852
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

391
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,922
But this one is a little more expensive.

392
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,356
This is 500 a gram.

393
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,826
But, when you shoot it,
you will know where that extra money went.

394
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,990
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

395
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,660
But this one is a fuckin' madman.

396
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,601
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.

397
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,665
Am I a nigger? Are we in Inglewood? No.

398
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,939
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

399
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,982
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

400
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,450
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

401
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,818
- Any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

402
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,723
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

403
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:18,819
Coke is fuckin' dead as dead.

404
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,730
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

405
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,494
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

406
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:31,009
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

407
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,840
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya...

408
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:38,076
but I'm givin' you
some out of my own private stash.

409
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,083
That is what a nice guy I am.

410
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,516
- I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

411
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,559
All right. I'll just get one for ya.

412
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:52,562
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and twistix from the kitchen?

413
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,222
Okay.

414
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,700
Hey, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

415
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,569
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

416
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,837
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

417
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,776
That's my wife.

418
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,016
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

419
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,680
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

420
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,518
I'll take a rain check.

421
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,122
Thank you, Jody.

422
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,389
Still got your Malibu?

423
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,692
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

424
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,702
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

425
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,365
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

426
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,102
I had it in storage for three years.

427
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,544
It was out five days, and some dickless
piece of shit fucked with it.

428
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:47,051
They should be fuckin' killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

429
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,818
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd
have given anything to catch that asshole.

430
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,915
It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.

431
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,620
What a fucker!

432
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,492
What's more chicken-shit than
fuckin' with a man's automobile?

433
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,465
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

434
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,933
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

435
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,493
Thank you.

436
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,070
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

437
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,442
Hi Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open.

438
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,749
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

439
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:14,963
Hello?

440
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,691
<i>Billy Raye was a preacher's son</i>

441
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,203
<i>And when his daddy would visit
he'd come along</i>

442
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,433
Vincent.

443
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,941
Vincent.

444
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,945
I'm on the intercom.

445
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,641
Where is... Where is the intercom?

446
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,080
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

447
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,246
To your right.

448
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,484
Warm.

449
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,960
Warmer.

450
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,720
Disco.

451
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,129
Hello?

452
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,800
Push the button if you want to talk.

453
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,930
Hello?

454
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,840
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll be down
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

455
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,509
The bar's by the fireplace.

456
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,240
Okay.

457
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,752
<i>When he started
sweet talkin' to me</i>

458
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,414
<i>He come and tell me
everything is all right</i>

459
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,288
<i>He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right</i>

460
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,293
<i>Can I get away again tonight</i>

461
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,989
<i>The only one
who could ever reach me</i>

462
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,657
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>

463
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,792
<i>The only boy
who could ever teach me</i>

464
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,839
<i>Was the son of a preacher man,
yes, he was</i>

465
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,203
<i>He was</i>

466
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,936
<i>Lord he knows he was,
yes, he was</i>

467
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,981
<i>How well I remember</i>

468
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,813
<i>The look that was in his eyes</i>

469
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,354
<i>Stealing kisses from me
on the sly</i>

470
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,015
<i>Taking time to make time</i>

471
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,615
<i>Telling me that he's all mine</i>

472
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,684
<i>Learning from each other's knowin'</i>

473
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,025
<i>Looking to see
how much we've grown</i>

474
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,328
<i>And the only one
who could ever reach me</i>

475
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,665
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>

476
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,672
<i>The only boy
who could ever teach me</i>

477
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,140
<i>Was the son of a preacher man,
yes, he was</i>

478
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,007
<i>Was, was, he was</i>

479
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,137
<i>Oh, yes, he was</i>

480
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,577
Let's go.

481
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,215
What the fuck is this place?

482
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,656
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

483
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,919
An Elvis man should love it.

484
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,490
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, Daddy-O.

485
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,092
Don't be a...

486
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,701
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

487
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:59,059
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

488
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,724
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

489
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,935
We reserved a car.

490
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:09,063
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

491
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,975
<i>School gal baby,
gonna tell you some news</i>

492
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,240
<i>Sure do look good
in them baby-doll shoes</i>

493
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:21,081
<i>It's one, two, buckle the shoes,
three, four, get out on the floor</i>

494
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:26,089
<i>Five, six, come get your kicks down at
the corner of Lincoln and 46th, yeah</i>

495
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,288
<i>All right</i>

496
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,796
<i>I've been waitin' in school
all day long</i>

497
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,960
<i>Waiting on the bell to ring
so I can go home</i>

498
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,561
<i>Throw my books on the table,
pick up the telephone</i>

499
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,629
<i>Come on, baby</i>

500
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,231
- Coffee, please? Decaf.
- Just a minute.

501
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,106
<i>Heading down to the drugstore
to get a soda pop</i>

502
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,509
<i>Throw a nickel in the jukebox
then we start to rock</i>

503
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,638
<i>School gal baby,
gonna tell you some news</i>

504
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,774
<i>You sure do look good
in them baby-doll shoes</i>

505
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,513
<i>Well, it's one, two,
buckle the shoes</i>

506
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,952
<i>Three, four,
get out on the floor</i>

507
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:01,925
<i>Five, six, come get your kicks down
at the corner of Lincoln and 46th</i>

508
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,757
<i>Gonna rock all night,
just wait and see</i>

509
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,860
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

510
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,274
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

511
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,038
Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.

512
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,703
Vincent!

513
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,982
Just to let you all know, Ricky will be
back in the second half of our show...

514
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:33,650
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

515
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,317
Thank you.

516
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:38,385
Call for...

517
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:42,489
Phil-lip Mor-ris.

518
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,296
What do you think?

519
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,501
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

520
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,541
Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you?

521
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:59,847
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh, yeah,
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

522
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,408
I'll have that.

523
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,181
How do you want that cooked?
Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?

524
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,418
Bloody as hell, and, oh, yeah,
look at this, vanilla coke.

525
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,917
What about you, Peggy Sue?

526
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:17,832
I'll have the
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

527
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:22,706
And a five-dollar shake.

528
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,504
How do you want that shake?
Martin and Lewis or Amos 'n Andy?

529
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,741
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

530
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:36,012
- That's a shake? That's milk and ice cream?
- Last I heard.

531
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,545
That's five dollars? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin'?

532
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,956
- No.
- Just checking.

533
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,721
I'll be right back with your drinks.

534
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:46,025
<i>To lonesome town</i>

535
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,796
<i>To cry my troubles away</i>

536
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,464
Could you
roll me one of those, cowboy?

537
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,407
You can have this one, cowgirl.

538
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,535
Thanks.

539
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,877
<i>The streets are filled with regret</i>

540
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,618
Think nothin' of it.

541
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,088
<i>Lay me down in lonesome town</i>

542
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,949
<i>I can learn to forget</i>

543
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:15,649
So...

544
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,820
Marsellus said you just
got back from Amsterdam.

545
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,058
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

546
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,665
Just over three years.

547
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:30,005
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

548
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,304
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

549
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,846
Why would you?

550
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,013
I heard you did a pilot.

551
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,782
That was my 15 minutes.

552
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,416
What was it?

553
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:53,157
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

554
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,960
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

555
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,298
Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks.

556
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,837
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

557
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,669
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

558
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:07,472
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

559
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,639
The Japanese Fox was a kung fu master.

560
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:14,811
The black girl was a demolition expert.

561
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,719
French Fox's speciality was sex.

562
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,380
What was your speciality?

563
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,548
Knives.

564
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,286
The character I played, Raven McCoy...

565
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,196
Her background was she grew up raised
by circus performers.

566
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:32,531
According to the show, she was the
deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

567
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,367
And she knew a zillion old jokes.

568
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:39,569
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

569
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,976
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

570
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,915
where every show
I would've told another joke.

571
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,884
You know any of them old jokes?

572
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:54,686
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

573
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,319
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

574
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,322
Don't be that way. Tell me.

575
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,923
No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

576
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:08,062
You'd be embarr... You told 50 million
people, and you can't tell me?

577
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:12,040
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

578
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,408
That's not what I meant. You know it.

579
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,913
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

580
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,711
What a gyp.

581
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,118
Martin and Lewis.

582
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,590
Vanilla coke.

583
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,262
Yummy.

584
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,302
You think I could have a sip of that?

585
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,034
Be my guest.

586
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,736
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

587
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,237
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

588
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,113
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties I can handle.

589
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,142
All right.

590
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,492
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake!

591
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,586
Told ya.

592
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,657
I don't know if it was worth five dollars,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

593
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,366
Don't you hate that?

594
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,133
Hate what?

595
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,539
Uncomfortable silences.

596
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:58,041
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

597
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,351
I don't know. That's a good question.

598
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,884
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

599
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:11,657
When you can just shut the fuck up
for a minute and comfortably share silence.

600
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:15,392
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,
but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

601
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,962
I'll tell you what.

602
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,803
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

603
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,072
You sit here
and think of something to say.

604
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,706
I'll do that.

605
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,548
Okay.

606
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,938
I said goddamn!

607
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,209
Goddamn! Goddamn.

608
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,409
I need some hair spray.

609
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:20,560
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom...

610
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,622
to find your food waiting for you?

611
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,928
We're lucky we got anything at all.

612
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,402
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

613
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,533
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

614
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,634
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

615
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:35,709
That is Marilyn Monroe.

616
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:39,880
That is Mamie Van Doren.

617
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,888
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

618
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,392
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

619
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,256
So did you think of somethin' to say?

620
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:52,319
Actually, I did.

621
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,932
However...

622
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,131
you seem like a really nice person, and I...

623
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,729
I don't want to offend you.

624
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:09,307
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,
boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

625
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,813
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

626
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,350
Well, well, I do. I do.

627
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,448
- But you have to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

628
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:23,620
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

629
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,594
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...

630
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,131
and my natural response could be
to get offended.

631
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,134
Then through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

632
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,864
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

633
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,998
Trying to forget anything as intriguing
as this would be an exercise in futility.

634
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,304
- Is that a fact?
- And besides...

635
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:43,814
isn't it more exciting
when you don't have permission?

636
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,371
All right, all right.

637
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,383
Well, here goes.

638
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,344
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

639
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:54,856
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

640
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,449
He fell out of a window.

641
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:00,129
Well, that is one way to say it.

642
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,962
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

643
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:06,162
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

644
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,829
Yet, even another way...

645
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,363
is to say he was thrown out of
a window by Marsellus because of you.

646
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,875
- Is that a fact?
- No.

647
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:17,072
No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard.
That's just what I heard.

648
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,683
- Who told you?
- They.

649
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,575
They talk a lot, don't they?

650
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,417
They certainly do. They certainly do.

651
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,516
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

652
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,255
I'm not shy.

653
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:34,531
Did it involve the 'F' word?

654
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,592
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.

655
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,369
- And?
- And nothin'. That's it.

656
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:50,042
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window...

657
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,708
for giving me a foot massage?

658
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,273
And you believe that?

659
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,880
Well, at the time I was told
it sounded reasonable.

660
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:02,050
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

661
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,526
for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?

662
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,928
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

663
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:11,468
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

664
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,138
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

665
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,971
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

666
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:22,068
But did it happen?

667
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:27,584
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it at my wedding.

668
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,984
Really?

669
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:33,579
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw
Tony out that window...

670
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,558
except Marsellus and Tony.

671
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,827
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

672
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:44,458
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

673
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:49,164
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

674
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,309
Now, this is where one lucky couple...

675
00:46:56,414 --> 00:47:00,851
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

676
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,478
Now, who will be our first contestants?

677
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,852
- Right here!
- All right!

678
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,949
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

679
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:14,760
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss...

680
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,767
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

681
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,999
Now I wanna dance,
I wanna win, I want that trophy.

682
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,666
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

683
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,606
Let's hear it for our first contestants.

684
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,818
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening.

685
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,479
Young lady, what is your name?

686
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,648
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

687
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,352
And how 'bout your fella here?

688
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,155
Vincent Vega.

689
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,789
All right, let's see what
you can do. Take it away!

690
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,129
- Go for it.
- Come on!

691
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:13,045
<i>It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well</i>

692
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:19,018
<i>You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle</i>

693
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:25,194
<i>And now the young monsieur and madame
have rung the chapel bell</i>

694
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:31,437
<i>C'est la vie say the old folks,
it goes to show you never can tell</i>

695
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:37,508
<i>They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale</i>

696
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:43,683
<i>The coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale</i>

697
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:49,458
<i>But when Pierre found work,
the little money comin' worked out well</i>

698
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:55,794
<i>C'est la vie say the old folks,
it goes to show you never can tell</i>

699
00:48:57,535 --> 00:49:01,904
<i>They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast</i>

700
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,207
<i>Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz</i>

701
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,043
<i>But when the sun went down,
the rapid tempo of the music fell</i>

702
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:20,980
<i>C'est la vie say the old folks,
it goes to show you never can tell</i>

703
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:50,749
<i>They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well</i>

704
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,749
<i>You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle</i>

705
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:35,159
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

706
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,530
I don't know what you call that.

707
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,297
Drinks! Music!

708
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,830
I'm gonna take a piss.

709
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:49,573
That's a little bit more information than
I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.

710
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,525
<i>Girl</i>

711
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:10,060
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

712
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,705
<i>I love you so much,
can't count all the ways</i>

713
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:18,742
<i>I'd die for you, girl,
and all they can say is</i>

714
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,833
<i>He's not your kind</i>

715
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:27,209
<i>You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around</i>

716
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,752
<i>What I'm gonna find</i>

717
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,845
<i>Don't let them
make up your mind</i>

718
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,390
<i>Don't you know, girl</i>

719
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,891
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

720
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:44,901
One drink and that's it.

721
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:48,962
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

722
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,975
Say good night and go home.

723
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:59,542
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

724
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,810
<i>Soon</i>

725
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:07,319
<i>You'll need a man</i>

726
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,924
<i>I've been misunderstood
for all of my life</i>

727
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:14,226
<i>But what they're sayin', girl,
it cuts like a knife</i>

728
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,788
<i>The boy's no good</i>

729
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,430
<i>Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for</i>

730
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,301
<i>But if they get a chance,
they'll end it for sure</i>

731
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:23,896
<i>Sure they would</i>

732
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,670
<i>Baby, I've done all I could</i>

733
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:31,408
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.

734
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,747
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.

735
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,117
Because being loyal is very important.

736
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:42,784
<i>You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around</i>

737
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,454
<i>What I'm gonna find</i>

738
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:49,488
<i>Don't let them
make up your mind</i>

739
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,433
<i>Don't you know, girl</i>

740
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:57,872
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

741
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,344
<i>Please</i>

742
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,709
<i>Come take my hand</i>

743
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,785
<i>Girl</i>

744
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:15,057
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

745
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,394
<i>Please</i>

746
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:22,627
<i>Come take my hand</i>

747
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,534
Hello.

748
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,731
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say...

749
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,139
Good night.
I've had a very lovely evening.

750
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:39,542
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home,
jerk off and that's all you gonna do.

751
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,255
<i>Now it's up to you, girl</i>

752
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:52,985
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

753
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,563
<i>Please</i>

754
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,263
<i>Come take my hand</i>

755
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,196
<i>Girl</i>

756
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:09,909
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

757
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,578
<i>Soon</i>

758
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,947
<i>You'll need a man</i>

759
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,889
All right, Mia.

760
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,794
So listen, I gotta go, all right?

761
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,272
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

762
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,072
You fu... Oh, Jesus Christ!

763
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:44,444
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me!

764
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:48,416
Oh, come on, girl. We're gettin' outta
here. We gotta walk now.

765
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,994
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

766
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,566
Fuck!

767
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,268
Answer.

768
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,777
<i>Have you got the ring?</i>

769
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:19,680
<i>- Why? Certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.</i>

770
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,149
<i>Please! Please!</i>

771
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,914
<i>Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.</i>

772
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,356
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

773
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,335
<i>Now what do you say?</i>

774
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,166
<i>I give up! I'll marry you!</i>

775
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,104
Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

776
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,474
I can hear it.

777
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:54,711
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes
never to call here this late!

778
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,308
Yeah, I told them.

779
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:59,651
And that is exactly what I'm going to tell
this fucking asshole right now.

780
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,957
<i>Don't you dare strike me!</i>

781
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:04,957
Hello.

782
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,326
Lance! Vincent.

783
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:10,298
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

784
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,466
Hold your horses, man.
What's the problem?

785
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,803
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' OD'in' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!

786
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,843
I'm not even joking with you!

787
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,208
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

788
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,337
- No choice.
- She's OD'in'?

789
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,000
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!

790
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,882
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

791
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,389
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

792
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,187
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

793
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:41,095
Are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

794
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:43,598
I don't know you. Who is this?
Don't come here!

795
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,861
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

796
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,047
What the hell was that?

797
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:03,714
Have you lost your fucking mind? You were
talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!

798
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,414
Lance, help me.

799
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,922
- You crashed your car into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

800
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:11,927
Are you deaf? You are not bringing this
fucked-up bitch into my house!

801
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,429
This fucked-up bitch is
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

802
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,556
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

803
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,431
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

804
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:25,099
I will be forced to tell him that you did
not help and let her die on your lawn.

805
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,642
Now, come on,
help me, help me. Pick her up.

806
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,645
Shit.

807
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,581
Lance!

808
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,085
Shit.

809
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:40,088
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

810
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,250
What the fuck's going on out here?

811
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,460
Who's she?

812
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:48,463
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenaline shot.

813
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,590
- What's wrong with her?
- She's OD'ing!

814
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,760
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

815
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:56,328
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

816
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,964
Just keep talking to her, all right?

817
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:00,839
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go
get my little black medical book.

818
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,935
What the fuck you need a medical book for?

819
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:05,447
I've never had to give
an adrenaline shot before!

820
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,951
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

821
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:11,453
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

822
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,955
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

823
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,958
- Get the shot!
- All right!

824
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:23,121
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

825
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,667
What's he looking for?

826
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:28,033
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

827
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:30,538
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

828
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,202
My little black medical book!
It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

829
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:38,213
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

830
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,613
If it's so important, why don't
you keep it with the shot?

831
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,276
I don't know!
Stop bothering me!

832
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,980
While you're looking, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet.

833
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:46,716
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

834
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,984
I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!

835
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:51,186
Lance, get in here!

836
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,785
- Right?
- Get the fuck outta my way.

837
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,491
Pig.

838
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,726
Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.

839
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,894
While I'm doing this,
you take off her shirt and find her heart.

840
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,998
- Does it gotta be exact?
- Yeah, it's gotta be exact.

841
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,304
We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.

842
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,537
I don't know exactly where
her heart is. I think it's right here.

843
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,135
- That's it.
- This it?

844
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,807
All right, what I need is
a big fat magic marker.

845
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,817
- You got it?
- What?

846
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,547
A magic marker. A felt pen!

847
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,248
A fuckin' black magic marker! Christ.

848
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:25,420
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

849
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,066
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

850
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,069
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

851
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,071
I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.

852
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,107
I never done this either!
I ain't starting now!

853
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,039
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

854
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,601
The day I bring an OD'ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

855
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,613
- Give her the shot.
- Give it to me. Give me that.

856
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,616
All right, tell me what to do.

857
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:52,210
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.

858
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,689
But she's got a breastplate.
You gotta pierce through that.

859
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,727
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

860
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,230
- I gotta stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

861
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:04,734
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

862
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,736
Once you do that,
you press down on the plunger.

863
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,272
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

864
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:13,274
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

865
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,241
She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's...

866
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:16,779
All right, count to three.

867
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,041
- All right. Ready?
- One.

868
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:25,879
Two.

869
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,155
Three!

870
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:53,678
If you're all right, then say something.

871
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:56,279
Something.

872
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:59,115
That was fuckin' trippy.

873
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:03,690
Oh, man.

874
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:31,320
Mia. Mia.

875
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,889
What's...

876
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:40,395
What's your thoughts on
how to handle this?

877
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,888
What's yours?

878
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:50,235
Well, I'm of the opinion that
if Marsellus lived his whole life...

879
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,808
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

880
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:58,971
If Marsellus knew about this incident,
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

881
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,914
I seriously doubt that.

882
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,245
I can keep a secret if you can.

883
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,080
Shake on it?

884
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,027
Mum's the word?

885
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,067
Cool.

886
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,430
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to
go home and have a heart attack.

887
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,097
Vincent.

888
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:32,004
Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke?

889
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,277
Sure.

890
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,077
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

891
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:41,089
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.

892
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:43,523
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

893
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,785
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

894
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,228
Three tomatoes are
walkin' down the street.

895
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,733
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

896
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:56,431
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

897
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:00,566
Goes back and squishes him and says
ketchup.

898
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:05,914
Ketchup.

899
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,145
See you around.

900
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:37,440
<i>Oh, that paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog.</i>

901
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:40,506
<i>He think totem pole alive.</i>

902
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:43,319
<i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>

903
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:47,454
<i>That totem pole been here forever!</i>

904
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:48,991
Butch?

905
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:51,925
<i>One more thing, and we'll start for...</i>

906
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:54,930
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

907
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,600
You've got a special visitor.

908
01:03:56,617 --> 01:03:58,009
<i>Stand up. Stand up.</i>

909
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:05,104
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a POW camp?

910
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:10,142
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

911
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,340
He was in the POW camp with Daddy.

912
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:23,551
Hello, little man.
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.

913
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:27,061
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.

914
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:32,526
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell
together, over five years.

915
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,969
Hopefully...

916
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:38,240
you'll never have to
experience this yourself...

917
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:42,004
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

918
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,876
for as long as we were...

919
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,882
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

920
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,979
If it'd been me who'd...

921
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:58,926
not made it, Major Coolidge'd
be talking right now to my son Jim.

922
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,593
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

923
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,432
Butch...

924
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,027
I got something for ya.

925
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,038
This watch I got here...

926
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:22,881
was first purchased by your
great-grandfather during the First World War.

927
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:27,389
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

928
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:31,257
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

929
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:34,091
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

930
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:37,530
It was bought by
Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

931
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,398
on the day he set sail for Paris.

932
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,768
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch...

933
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:46,433
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

934
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:50,070
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother...

935
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:54,583
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

936
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:58,883
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

937
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,891
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

938
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,052
This time they called it World War II.

939
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:10,489
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

940
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:14,560
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
as good as his old man's.

941
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,572
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...

942
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,336
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

943
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,678
Your granddad was facing death.

944
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,442
He knew it.

945
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:30,646
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive...

946
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,950
so three days before
the Japanese took the island...

947
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:39,256
your granddad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki,

948
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,264
a man he'd never met before in his life...

949
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,301
to deliver to his infant son...

950
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:49,964
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

951
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:54,373
Three days later, your granddad was dead,
but Winocki kept his word.

952
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,675
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother...

953
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:03,013
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

954
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,019
This watch.

955
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:16,332
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

956
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,835
He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.

957
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:23,964
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...

958
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,838
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

959
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:31,341
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

960
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:35,145
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their
greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright...

961
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:39,348
so he hid it in one place
he knew he could hide something, his ass.

962
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:42,858
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

963
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:47,090
Then he died of dysentery.
He give me the watch.

964
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:51,030
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

965
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,034
Then...

966
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:57,198
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

967
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:58,706
now...

968
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:04,580
little man, I give the watch to you.

969
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,371
It's time, Butch.

970
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,048
<i>In the lightweight division...</i>

971
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,244
<i>in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks...</i>

972
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,584
<i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>

973
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:49,819
<i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>

974
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,386
<i>It's official, it's official,
Wilson is dead!</i>

975
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,296
<i>Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest...</i>

976
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,800
<i>and hands down, the most brutal
fight this city's ever seen.</i>

977
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,235
<i>Coolidge was out of there faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.</i>

978
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,968
<i>- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.</i>

979
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:10,478
<i>I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.</i>

980
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,445
<i>I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.</i>

981
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:15,484
<i>Do you feel this tragedy
is gonna affect the world of boxing?</i>

982
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:19,487
<i>A tragedy like this can't help but shake
the world of boxing to its very foundations.</i>

983
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:23,457
<i>It's of paramount importance, during the sad
weeks ahead, the eyes of the WBA remain...</i>

984
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,159
Man, you know I didn't...

985
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,165
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

986
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,167
I didn't do it.

987
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,726
- How you doing?
- Great.

988
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,738
I never thanked you for dinner.

989
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:15,076
- What you got?
- He booked.

990
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:18,511
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

991
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:21,744
- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna think.

992
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:25,412
We wanna know. Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

993
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,354
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

994
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,221
Butch's search, how do you want it done?

995
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,589
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

996
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,927
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

997
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:41,766
- Ready to pop a cap in his ass.
- I will take care of it.

998
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,013
Mister.

999
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,387
- Hey, mister.
- What?

1000
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:04,256
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

1001
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,796
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

1002
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:10,593
No, come on.

1003
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,634
You're him.

1004
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,135
I know you're him.

1005
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:18,771
Tell me you're him.

1006
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,775
I'm him.

1007
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:23,971
You killed the other boxing man.

1008
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,043
He's dead?

1009
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,553
The radio said he was dead.

1010
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,554
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1011
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:41,319
What does it feel like?

1012
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,330
What does what feel like?

1013
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,922
Killing a man.

1014
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:51,163
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1015
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:53,332
What are you, a weirdo?

1016
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:58,004
No. It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1017
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:03,946
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

1018
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,156
So?

1019
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:11,990
What does it feel like to kill a man?

1020
01:12:13,596 --> 01:12:15,188
I'll tell you what.

1021
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:18,756
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up
there and I'll tell you all about it.

1022
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,485
So, Esmarelda...

1023
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:45,191
Villa Lobos. Is that Mexican?

1024
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:48,491
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.

1025
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,829
- That's some handle you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

1026
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,869
And what is your name?

1027
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,631
Butch.

1028
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,499
Butch.

1029
01:12:58,074 --> 01:12:59,564
What does it mean?

1030
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:02,166
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1031
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:07,709
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda...

1032
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:10,081
What is it you want to know?

1033
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:15,055
- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1034
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,660
I didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1035
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:28,267
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1036
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:36,267
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.

1037
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:49,953
What the fuck'd I tell ya?

1038
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:54,595
As soon as the word got out the fix was
in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1039
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:56,892
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

1040
01:13:56,966 --> 01:14:00,402
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better
boxer, he'd still be alive.

1041
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,936
If he never laced up his gloves...

1042
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:04,905
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1043
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:10,571
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1044
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,308
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1045
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:16,078
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1046
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,320
How many bookies did you lay it around on?

1047
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:22,948
All eight? How long to collect?

1048
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:27,428
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
No, I understand.

1049
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,624
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1050
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,928
That is great news, man.

1051
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:36,438
Yeah. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1052
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,571
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1053
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,338
Okay, my brother.

1054
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,977
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1055
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:50,575
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1056
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,143
Cool, brother.

1057
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,035
$45.60.

1058
01:15:14,377 --> 01:15:18,837
And here's a little something
for the effort.

1059
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:23,476
Now if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1060
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:24,985
The truth.

1061
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:28,854
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1062
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,326
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1063
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:35,956
Buenas noches, Butch.

1064
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,347
Keep the light off.

1065
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:55,384
- Is that better, sugar pop?
- Oui.

1066
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,755
Hard day at the office?

1067
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:03,757
Pretty hard.

1068
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,486
Got in a fight.

1069
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,323
Poor baby.

1070
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,922
Can you make spoons?

1071
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,092
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1072
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:16,933
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1073
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,940
Let me take this jacket off.

1074
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,572
I was looking
at myself in the mirror.

1075
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,182
I wish I had a pot.

1076
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,944
You were looking at yourself in the mirror
and you wish you had some pot?

1077
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:36,081
A pot. A pot belly.

1078
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,086
Pot bellies are sexy.

1079
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:41,459
Well, you should be happy...

1080
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:43,888
'cause you have one.

1081
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:47,026
Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.

1082
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,937
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did Lucky Star.

1083
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,735
It's not the same thing.

1084
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:55,936
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1085
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:57,945
The difference is huge.

1086
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:02,449
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1087
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,212
No.

1088
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:08,620
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1089
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:12,125
But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.

1090
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:17,632
The rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...

1091
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:21,760
but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.

1092
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:26,570
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small to accentuate it.

1093
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,270
You think men would find that attractive?

1094
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:32,508
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1095
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:36,073
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1096
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,086
is seldom the same.

1097
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,085
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1098
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,096
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1099
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,098
I'd smother you!

1100
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:54,102
I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!

1101
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,104
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1102
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,106
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1103
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:13,611
Did you get everything?

1104
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,658
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, sugar pop.

1105
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,659
Did everything go as planned?

1106
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,691
You didn't listen to the...

1107
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:23,464
You didn't listen to the radio?

1108
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,831
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1109
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:29,200
I won, all right.

1110
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:32,240
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1111
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:34,703
So it all worked out in the finish.

1112
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:37,908
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1113
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:49,923
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

1114
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:54,395
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

1115
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:58,900
But they won't find us, will they?

1116
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:05,001
Do you still want me to go with you?

1117
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:10,939
I don't want to be
a burden or a nuisance. It's...

1118
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,076
Say it.

1119
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:24,682
Fabienne,
I want you to be with me.

1120
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:28,886
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1121
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,967
Do you love me?

1122
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:35,059
Very, very much.

1123
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,301
- Butch.
- Yes?

1124
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,374
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1125
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,818
Will you kiss it?

1126
01:19:52,755 --> 01:19:54,916
But you first.

1127
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,322
- Okay.
- Okay.

1128
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,298
Butch.

1129
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:31,825
I think I cracked a rib.

1130
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:35,328
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1131
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:38,832
- Don't call me retard.
- My name is Fabby.

1132
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,425
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1133
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,993
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi...

1134
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:46,438
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1135
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,602
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1136
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,612
I take it back.

1137
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:57,517
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1138
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:01,521
Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1139
01:21:01,619 --> 01:21:03,821
Tulip is much better than mongoloid.

1140
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:07,027
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1141
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,222
And I took it back.

1142
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:11,390
Butch?

1143
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,400
Yes, lemon pie?

1144
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:16,903
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1145
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,132
Wherever you want.

1146
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,142
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this...

1147
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,371
but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...

1148
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:26,812
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1149
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:31,644
I was thinking maybe we could go down
someplace in the South Pacific.

1150
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,156
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1151
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,159
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1152
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,663
And if after a while you didn't dig that,
we could go someplace else.

1153
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,164
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1154
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,167
But I do not speak Spanish.

1155
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,204
Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.

1156
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,898
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1157
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:56,240
- What does that mean?
- Where is the shoe store?

1158
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,406
Spit, please.

1159
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:03,581
Excellent pronunciation.

1160
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,018
You'll be my little mamacita in no time.

1161
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:13,888
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1162
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:15,452
Time for bed.

1163
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,600
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1164
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,741
Butch?

1165
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,582
Never mind.

1166
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:49,822
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1167
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,004
What is this you're watching?

1168
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:06,512
A motorcycle movie.
I'm not sure the name.

1169
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:11,510
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1170
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:16,752
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1171
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,462
What was it about?

1172
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,693
How should I know?
You were the one watching it.

1173
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,793
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1174
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,805
I don't remember.

1175
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:33,774
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1176
01:23:33,903 --> 01:23:36,374
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1177
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:41,611
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1178
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,378
One more kiss and I'll get up.

1179
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,816
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1180
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,018
Get up, lazy bones!

1181
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:56,555
God.

1182
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,358
- What time is it?
- Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1183
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:05,201
- What time does our train arrive?
- 11:00.

1184
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:08,572
- You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
- What, lemon pie?

1185
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:15,843
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...

1186
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:19,354
eggs over easy and five sausages.

1187
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,651
Anything to drink with that?

1188
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,089
Wow, that looks nice.

1189
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:31,263
To drink, a tall glass of orange juice
and a black cup of coffee.

1190
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:35,894
- After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1191
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:39,269
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1192
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,442
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.

1193
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:46,002
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.

1194
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,015
Where's my watch?

1195
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,718
It's there.

1196
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,918
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1197
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,756
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1198
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:03,924
You sure you got it?

1199
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,296
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1200
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:09,529
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1201
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:12,802
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1202
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,702
Well, it should be.

1203
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:19,611
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's
not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1204
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:28,611
Fabienne, where's my father's
fucking watch?

1205
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:33,819
Do you have any idea what he had to go
through to get me that watch?

1206
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:37,229
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1207
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:40,894
All this other shit you could've set on
fire, but I specifically reminded you...

1208
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,496
not to forget the fucking watch!
Now think.

1209
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:48,098
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1210
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:51,475
You believe so? What the fuck does that
mean? You either did or didn't get it.

1211
01:25:52,848 --> 01:25:54,816
Then I did.

1212
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:58,084
Are you sure?

1213
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:01,155
No.

1214
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:05,158
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1215
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,592
Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'...

1216
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,295
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1217
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:14,335
No!

1218
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:18,872
It's not your fault.

1219
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:26,146
You left it at the apartment.

1220
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:34,481
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1221
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,125
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.

1222
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:44,054
I reminded you about it...

1223
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:47,966
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1224
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:52,330
If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,
I shoulda told you that.

1225
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,908
You're not a mind reader.

1226
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:57,501
Are you?

1227
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:09,982
I'm sorry.

1228
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,653
Don't be. Just means I can't have
breakfast with you.

1229
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,425
Why does it mean that?

1230
01:27:19,034 --> 01:27:22,333
Because I gotta go back
to my apartment and get my watch.

1231
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:26,063
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1232
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,234
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

1233
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:34,744
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it, then I'll split.

1234
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:40,117
I saw your watch.
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1235
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:48,427
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1236
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,395
Have a nice breakfast.

1237
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,229
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back before
you can say blueberry pie.

1238
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:54,791
Blueberry pie.

1239
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:58,598
Maybe not that fast.

1240
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:01,904
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1241
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:04,275
- Bye.
- Bye.

1242
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:06,939
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget...

1243
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:09,039
she forgets my father's watch!

1244
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,778
I specifically reminded her.

1245
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:13,480
Bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1246
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,819
I said the words...
Don't forget my father's watch.

1247
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,776
<i>Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...</i>

1248
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:55,716
Lookin' good, Butch.

1249
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:46,878
<i>If I were walkin' in your shoes</i>

1250
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,980
<i>I wouldn't worry much</i>

1251
01:33:54,429 --> 01:33:58,729
<i>Countin' flowers on the wall
that don't bother me at all</i>

1252
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:04,337
<i>Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of 51</i>

1253
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:07,340
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.

1254
01:34:07,442 --> 01:34:10,639
They keep underestimatin' ya.

1255
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,679
<i>Now don't tell me</i>

1256
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:17,685
<i>Countin' flowers on the wall</i>

1257
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:20,253
<i>That don't bother me at all</i>

1258
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:26,817
<i>Playin' solitaire 'til dawn

1259
01:34:26,928 --> 01:34:31,627
<i>Smokin' cigarettes and
watchin' Captain Kangaroo</i>

1260
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:34,634
<i>Now don't tell me</i>

1261
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:37,136
<i>I've nothin' to do</i>

1262
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:39,469
<i>It's good to see you,
I must go</i>

1263
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:41,600
<i>I know I look a fright</i>

1264
01:34:42,676 --> 01:34:44,144
Motherfucker.

1265
01:34:44,212 --> 01:34:46,612
<i>Are not accustomed...</i>

1266
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:57,189
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

1267
01:34:57,292 --> 01:34:59,522
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1268
01:35:09,404 --> 01:35:13,340
If you need someone to go to court, I'll be
glad to help. That guy was a drunken maniac.

1269
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:16,343
He hit you, then he crashed into that car.

1270
01:35:16,411 --> 01:35:18,311
- Who?
- Him.

1271
01:35:22,417 --> 01:35:24,578
I'll be damned.

1272
01:35:41,336 --> 01:35:43,065
I'm shot!

1273
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:51,607
Sally! Sally!

1274
01:36:00,555 --> 01:36:02,455
Motherfucker!

1275
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:08,562
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.

1276
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:11,565
Now you just wait a goddamn minute now!

1277
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:13,601
What the fuck you up to?

1278
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:16,295
Come here, motherfucker!

1279
01:36:16,404 --> 01:36:19,271
You feel that sting, big boy?

1280
01:36:19,374 --> 01:36:21,274
That's pride fuckin' with you, see?

1281
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:23,310
You gotta fight through that shit!

1282
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:27,871
- You'd better kill me...
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1283
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,474
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to...

1284
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:33,076
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1285
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:36,920
- This ain't none of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1286
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:39,721
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1287
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,819
Toss the weapon.

1288
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:48,060
<i>It's time to find love</i>

1289
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:49,831
Take your foot off the nigger.

1290
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:51,837
Put your hand behind your head.

1291
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:53,964
Approach the counter right now.

1292
01:36:54,075 --> 01:36:56,839
This motherfucker's trying to
kill me.

1293
01:36:57,345 --> 01:37:01,338
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.

1294
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:08,354
<i>If love is shelter</i>

1295
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,999
Zed. Maynard.

1296
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,944
Yeah, the spider just
caught a couple flies.

1297
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:35,471
<i>Whoa, my angel</i>

1298
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:41,180
<i>Down to you</i>

1299
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:23,763
Nobody kills anybody in my place
of business except me or Zed.

1300
01:38:28,035 --> 01:38:29,696
That's Zed.

1301
01:38:42,617 --> 01:38:45,552
- I thought you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1302
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:53,292
Then how come they're all beat up?

1303
01:38:54,529 --> 01:38:57,589
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1304
01:38:57,698 --> 01:38:59,757
Now, this 'un right here...

1305
01:38:59,867 --> 01:39:02,768
- He was gonna shoot that one.
- Is that right?

1306
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:05,464
You gonna shoot him, boy?

1307
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:13,204
Hey, is Grace all right out front?

1308
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:16,478
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.

1309
01:39:16,584 --> 01:39:18,245
She oughta be fine.

1310
01:39:21,656 --> 01:39:24,921
Well, bring out the gimp.

1311
01:39:25,993 --> 01:39:28,757
I think the gimp's sleepin'.

1312
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:31,663
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?

1313
01:40:11,873 --> 01:40:13,807
Get up.

1314
01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:29,022
Get down.

1315
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,494
Which one of 'em you wanna do first?

1316
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:45,334
I ain't for sure yet.

1317
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:52,005
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo...

1318
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:54,673
catch a nigger...

1319
01:40:54,749 --> 01:40:57,343
by his toe.

1320
01:40:57,418 --> 01:41:01,184
If he hollers, let him go.

1321
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:05,419
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1322
01:41:08,429 --> 01:41:11,330
My mother said...

1323
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:14,994
pick the perfect one...

1324
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,061
and... you... are...

1325
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:21,439
it.

1326
01:41:23,778 --> 01:41:26,838
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!

1327
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,385
You wanna do it in here?

1328
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:35,718
No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1329
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:38,520
Sounds good to me.

1330
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,750
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1331
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:35,514
Yeah!

1332
01:42:38,586 --> 01:42:41,749
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1333
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,517

Yeah!

1339
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:12,242
Come on! Get down there!

1340
01:44:15,783 --> 01:44:18,115
Do it! Yeah!

1341
01:44:35,236 --> 01:44:37,227
Yeah! Yeah!

1342
01:44:53,154 --> 01:44:54,781
Shut the fuck up!

1343
01:44:58,926 --> 01:45:00,325
Fuck him!

1344
01:45:02,997 --> 01:45:04,965
Come on!

1345
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:11,504
Fuck him. Yeah.

1346
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:45,033
You want that gun, don't ya, Zed?

1347
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:51,543
Go ahead and pick it up.

1348
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:56,279
Go ahead, pick it up.

1349
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:01,043
Come on. Thatta boy!

1350
01:46:02,656 --> 01:46:06,717
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1351
01:46:10,998 --> 01:46:14,058
Step aside, Butch.

1352
01:46:26,313 --> 01:46:28,042
Fuck!

1353
01:46:31,919 --> 01:46:33,511
You okay?

1354
01:46:36,257 --> 01:46:38,418
No, man.

1355
01:46:39,026 --> 01:46:41,927
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1356
01:46:53,107 --> 01:46:55,541
What now?

1357
01:46:57,878 --> 01:46:59,778
What now?

1358
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:03,115
Let me tell you what now.

1359
01:47:04,685 --> 01:47:07,586
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1360
01:47:07,688 --> 01:47:10,350
to go to work on the homes here...

1361
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,120
with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

1362
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:18,292
You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy?

1363
01:47:19,566 --> 01:47:22,091
I ain't through with you by a damn sight!

1364
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:24,636
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

1365
01:47:28,409 --> 01:47:31,310
I meant what now between me and you.

1366
01:47:36,417 --> 01:47:38,317
Oh, that what now.

1367
01:47:40,254 --> 01:47:42,950
I tell you what now between me and you.

1368
01:47:45,759 --> 01:47:48,660
There is no me and you.

1369
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,064
Not no more.

1370
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:57,069
So, are we cool?

1371
01:47:58,439 --> 01:48:00,100
Yeah, we cool.

1372
01:48:01,442 --> 01:48:02,932
Two things.

1373
01:48:04,678 --> 01:48:07,647
Don't tell nobody about this.

1374
01:48:09,116 --> 01:48:12,745
This shit is between me, you...

1375
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:17,280
and Mr. Soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest
of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain...

1376
01:48:17,358 --> 01:48:19,292
rapist here.

1377
01:48:20,594 --> 01:48:23,324
It ain't nobody else's business.

1378
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,330
Two...

1379
01:48:25,432 --> 01:48:28,924
You leave town tonight. Right now.

1380
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:33,867
And when you gone,
you stay gone...

1381
01:48:33,974 --> 01:48:35,874
or you be gone.

1382
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:39,675
You lost all your L.A. privileges. Deal?

1383
01:48:41,949 --> 01:48:43,280
Deal.

1384
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,053
Get your ass outta here.

1385
01:49:13,514 --> 01:49:15,414
Oh, shit.

1386
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:50,507
Fabienne!

1387
01:49:52,286 --> 01:49:53,719
Fabienne!

1388
01:49:56,623 --> 01:49:58,716
Fabienne! Come on, baby.

1389
01:49:58,792 --> 01:50:00,692
Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.

1390
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:02,388
I was so worried.
What about our bags?

1391
01:50:02,463 --> 01:50:04,727
Fuck the bags. If we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1392
01:50:04,798 --> 01:50:07,733
- Come on, I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1393
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:11,430
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1394
01:50:15,075 --> 01:50:16,633
Come on, honey!

1395
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:21,646
Where did you get this motorcycle?

1396
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:24,216
It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.

1397
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:26,252
What happened to my Honda?

1398
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,086
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that
Honda. Will you come on now, please?

1399
01:50:30,157 --> 01:50:32,625
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1400
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:38,098
You're hurt?

1401
01:50:38,165 --> 01:50:40,599
No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1402
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:43,602
Come on. Hop on. Baby, please, we...

1403
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:46,468
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1404
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:52,438
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here. I'm sorry.

1405
01:50:53,747 --> 01:50:55,237
I'm so sorry.

1406
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,749
You were gone so long,
I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1407
01:50:57,818 --> 01:51:00,753
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1408
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:02,755
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1409
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:04,757
Did you get the blueberry pancakes?

1410
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:07,760
They didn't have blueberry. I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1411
01:51:07,828 --> 01:51:10,763
Since I left you, this has been,
without a doubt...

1412
01:51:10,831 --> 01:51:15,029
the single weirdest fuckin' day
of my life. I'll tell you all about it.

1413
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:16,932
Gotta go. Come on.

1414
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:19,802
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1415
01:51:19,873 --> 01:51:22,467
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1416
01:51:22,543 --> 01:51:24,477
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1417
01:51:24,545 --> 01:51:27,480
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

1418
01:51:43,297 --> 01:51:45,561
Yes, you did, Brett!

1419
01:51:45,666 --> 01:51:49,158
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus
Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1420
01:51:49,236 --> 01:51:51,670
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1421
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:54,832
- Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1422
01:51:54,908 --> 01:51:58,344
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1423
01:51:58,412 --> 01:52:00,573
Sorta fits the occasion.

1424
01:52:00,681 --> 01:52:03,980
Ezekiel 25:17.

1425
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:08,351
The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1426
01:52:08,422 --> 01:52:13,655
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

1427
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:18,562
Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

1428
01:52:18,665 --> 01:52:21,691
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness...

1429
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:24,259
for he is truly his brothers keeper...

1430
01:52:24,371 --> 01:52:27,067
and the finder of lost children.

1431
01:52:27,174 --> 01:52:33,670
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance and furious anger...

1432
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:38,116
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

1433
01:52:38,218 --> 01:52:42,052
And you will know my name is the Lord...

1434
01:52:42,122 --> 01:52:45,523
when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

1435
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,068
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1436
01:52:56,136 --> 01:52:59,071
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1437
01:52:59,139 --> 01:53:01,733
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1438
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:03,571
Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.

1439
01:53:03,644 --> 01:53:06,442
Marvin. Marvin. Marvin!

1440
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:08,810
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1441
01:53:09,416 --> 01:53:12,579
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1442
01:53:40,747 --> 01:53:44,148
Why the fuck didn't you
tell us somebody was in the bathroom?

1443
01:53:44,251 --> 01:53:47,118
Slip your mind? Did you forget that
someone was in there...

1444
01:53:47,187 --> 01:53:49,087
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1445
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:52,353
You see the size of that gun
he fired at us? It was bigger than him.

1446
01:53:57,864 --> 01:54:00,594
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1447
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,601
I know. We was lucky.

1448
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:05,763
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1449
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,170
Yeah, maybe.

1450
01:54:07,274 --> 01:54:10,038
This was divine intervention.

1451
01:54:10,143 --> 01:54:12,043
You know what divine intervention is?

1452
01:54:17,951 --> 01:54:19,851
I think so.

1453
01:54:19,953 --> 01:54:23,354
That means that God came down from heaven
and stopped the bullets.

1454
01:54:23,457 --> 01:54:25,857
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1455
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:28,894
God came down from heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1456
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:32,131
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1457
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:34,565
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1458
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:36,727
What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle!

1459
01:54:36,837 --> 01:54:38,634
Chill. This shit happens.

1460
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:41,469
Wrong! Wrong. This shit
doesn't just happen.

1461
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:44,977
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1462
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:47,513
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1463
01:54:47,581 --> 01:54:49,242
We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!

1464
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:54,486
What happened here was a miracle,
and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1465
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:58,820
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1466
01:55:06,266 --> 01:55:09,360
Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.

1467
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:13,373
You ever seen that show Cops?

1468
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:16,375
I was watching it one time
and there was this cop on...

1469
01:55:16,443 --> 01:55:20,379
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he
had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1470
01:55:20,447 --> 01:55:23,883
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1471
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:26,510
Okay? It was just him and this guy.

1472
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:30,283
I mean, you know,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1473
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:32,756
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

1474
01:55:32,859 --> 01:55:35,293
but me, my eyes
are wide fuckin' open.

1475
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:37,090
What the fuck does that mean?

1476
01:55:37,197 --> 01:55:38,687
It means that's it for me.

1477
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:41,063
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1478
01:55:41,134 --> 01:55:43,295
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1479
01:55:43,403 --> 01:55:46,429
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1480
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:49,566
Look, I'm tellin'
Marsellus today, I'm through.

1481
01:55:49,643 --> 01:55:52,578
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.

1482
01:55:52,646 --> 01:55:56,639
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1483
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:59,817
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1484
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,320
Man, I don't even have an opinion.

1485
01:56:02,422 --> 01:56:06,654
You gotta have an opinion. You think God
came down from heaven and stopped...

1486
01:56:07,327 --> 01:56:08,919
What the fuck's happenin'?

1487
01:56:08,995 --> 01:56:10,724
- Shit, man!
- Man!

1488
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:13,732
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1489
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,427
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

1490
01:56:15,502 --> 01:56:17,970
Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this...

1491
01:56:18,071 --> 01:56:21,734
Chill out, man! It was an accident.
We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1492
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,742
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.

1493
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:27,109
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1494
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:30,616
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on a city
street in broad daylight here!

1495
01:56:30,684 --> 01:56:32,618
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1496
01:56:32,686 --> 01:56:37,146
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1497
01:56:37,257 --> 01:56:40,158
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1498
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:42,660
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1499
01:56:42,762 --> 01:56:45,162
- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!

1500
01:56:45,265 --> 01:56:47,665
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1501
01:56:47,767 --> 01:56:51,259
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1502
01:56:51,938 --> 01:56:54,805
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do...

1503
01:56:54,875 --> 01:56:57,309
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1504
01:56:57,377 --> 01:57:01,313
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules, just listen up, man.

1505
01:57:01,381 --> 01:57:05,317
Me and my homeboy are in a car,
and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1506
01:57:05,385 --> 01:57:07,546
I need to use your garage
for a couple of hours.

1507
01:57:09,055 --> 01:57:11,990
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1508
01:57:12,058 --> 01:57:14,686
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1509
01:57:14,794 --> 01:57:18,696
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls.

1510
01:57:18,798 --> 01:57:21,699
But I don't want it to reach that pitch.
Jimmie's a friend.

1511
01:57:21,801 --> 01:57:23,894
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1512
01:57:24,004 --> 01:57:26,199
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1513
01:57:26,306 --> 01:57:28,706
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1514
01:57:28,808 --> 01:57:31,971
Put yourself in his position.
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1515
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,979
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1516
01:57:34,047 --> 01:57:36,982
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1517
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:40,884
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1518
01:57:40,987 --> 01:57:43,387
Fuck nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?

1519
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:44,980
I was dryin' my hands!

1520
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:47,993
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1521
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:51,326
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1522
01:57:51,398 --> 01:57:53,593
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1523
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,600
I used the same fuckin' soap you did...

1524
01:57:55,702 --> 01:57:58,603
and when I finished, the towel didn't look
like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1525
01:57:58,705 --> 01:58:00,866
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1526
01:58:00,941 --> 01:58:04,240
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1527
01:58:05,879 --> 01:58:09,280
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1528
01:58:09,382 --> 01:58:13,842
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1529
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,582
All right. Fine. Fine.

1530
01:58:16,690 --> 01:58:18,851
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1531
01:58:19,693 --> 01:58:22,628
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1532
01:58:25,465 --> 01:58:27,228
Goddamn, Jimmie!

1533
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,359
This some serious gourmet shit.

1534
01:58:29,436 --> 01:58:33,395
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied
with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1535
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:37,910
Right? And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1536
01:58:37,978 --> 01:58:40,538
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1537
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:41,581
What?

1538
01:58:41,648 --> 01:58:44,640
I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1539
01:58:44,751 --> 01:58:47,242
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1540
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,220
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.

1541
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:52,918
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff
'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1542
01:58:52,993 --> 01:58:56,929
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1543
01:58:56,997 --> 01:58:59,158
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1544
01:58:59,265 --> 01:59:00,960
Jimmie, don't even worry...

1545
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:03,092
Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1546
01:59:03,169 --> 01:59:04,659
When you came pulling in here...

1547
01:59:04,771 --> 01:59:07,934
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said Dead Nigger Storage?

1548
01:59:08,008 --> 01:59:09,737
You know I ain't seen no...

1549
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:13,472
Did you notice the sign on the front of
my house that said Dead Nigger Storage?

1550
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:16,274
No. I didn't.

1551
01:59:16,349 --> 01:59:19,250
- You know why you didn't see that sign?
- Why?

1552
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:23,847
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead
niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1553
01:59:23,957 --> 01:59:26,858
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker...
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1554
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:31,363
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1555
01:59:31,464 --> 01:59:34,661
No marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1556
01:59:34,768 --> 01:59:38,101
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1557
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:43,165
Man, you know, fuck I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1558
01:59:43,276 --> 01:59:45,335
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.

1559
01:59:45,445 --> 01:59:49,347
Don't fuckin' Jimmie me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' Jimmie me.

1560
01:59:49,449 --> 01:59:53,385
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna
make me forget I love my wife. Is there?

1561
01:59:55,955 --> 02:00:01,188
Now, look you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1562
02:00:01,294 --> 02:00:03,888
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1563
02:00:03,997 --> 02:00:07,489
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1564
02:00:07,567 --> 02:00:11,503
Well, then do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1565
02:00:11,571 --> 02:00:14,404
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1566
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:17,499
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1567
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:20,512
You're fucking my shit up right now!

1568
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:23,674
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1569
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:27,242
Do me that favor, all right? The phone is
in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1570
02:00:27,353 --> 02:00:30,254
Well, say she comes home.

1571
02:00:30,356 --> 02:00:31,983
What do you think she'll do?

1572
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:36,694
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1573
02:00:36,763 --> 02:00:38,993
That ain't no kinda answer.

1574
02:00:39,065 --> 02:00:42,091
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1575
02:00:42,202 --> 02:00:47,037
You got to appreciate what an explosive
element this Bonnie situation is.

1576
02:00:47,107 --> 02:00:51,043
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...

1577
02:00:51,111 --> 02:00:53,045
doing a bunch of gangster shit.

1578
02:00:53,113 --> 02:00:56,207
There ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1579
02:00:58,384 --> 02:01:00,284
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1580
02:01:00,386 --> 02:01:02,946
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.

1581
02:01:03,056 --> 02:01:05,081
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1582
02:01:05,191 --> 02:01:06,852
All I want to hear from your ass is...

1583
02:01:06,926 --> 02:01:09,952
You ain't got no problem, Jules,
I'm on the motherfucker.

1584
02:01:10,063 --> 02:01:14,193
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be coming directly.

1585
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:17,430
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1586
02:01:17,537 --> 02:01:19,630
I'm on the motherfucker.

1587
02:01:19,739 --> 02:01:24,802
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1588
02:01:25,545 --> 02:01:27,274
You sendin' the Wolf?

1589
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:29,541
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?

1590
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,914
Shit, negro!

1591
02:01:31,985 --> 02:01:34,112
That's all you had to say!

1592
02:01:35,155 --> 02:01:37,146
She the hysterical type?

1593
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:39,982
When is she due?

1594
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:45,564
Give me the principals' names again.

1595
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:47,566
Place your bets.

1596
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:51,001
- Jules.
- Cards, please.

1597
02:01:52,338 --> 02:01:54,306
Vincent.

1598
02:01:59,012 --> 02:02:00,502
Jimmie.

1599
02:02:02,182 --> 02:02:03,581
Bonnie.

1600
02:02:09,756 --> 02:02:12,691
It's 30 minutes away. I'll be there in 10.

1601
02:02:29,676 --> 02:02:32,611
You're Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1602
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:36,308
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1603
02:02:36,382 --> 02:02:39,317
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1604
02:02:39,385 --> 02:02:41,285
Yeah. Please do.

1605
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:45,017
You must be Jules.
Which would make you Vincent.

1606
02:02:45,124 --> 02:02:47,524
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1607
02:02:47,627 --> 02:02:50,323
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1608
02:02:50,396 --> 02:02:51,863
One hundred percent.

1609
02:02:51,965 --> 02:02:55,366
Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the A.M., correct?

1610
02:02:56,636 --> 02:03:01,130
I was led to believe if she comes home and
finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1611
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:02,674
She wouldn't at that.

1612
02:03:02,742 --> 02:03:05,472
That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge...

1613
02:03:05,545 --> 02:03:09,003
which, if you do what I say, when I say it,
should be plenty.

1614
02:03:09,082 --> 02:03:13,416
Now, you got a corpse in a car,
minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1615
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:22,560
Jimmie.

1616
02:03:23,162 --> 02:03:26,188
Do me a favor, will ya?
Thought I smelled some coffee back there.

1617
02:03:26,266 --> 02:03:30,100
- Would you make me a cup?
- Yeah, sure.

1618
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:34,506
Oh, how do you take it?

1619
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:36,098
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1620
02:03:39,512 --> 02:03:42,242
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1621
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:45,613
Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it?

1622
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:49,347
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
- Positive?

1623
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:52,118
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1624
02:03:52,225 --> 02:03:55,285
As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.

1625
02:03:55,395 --> 02:03:57,260
Good enough.

1626
02:03:57,363 --> 02:03:59,354
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1627
02:04:05,038 --> 02:04:07,472
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1628
02:04:15,815 --> 02:04:17,908
Okay, first thing. You two.

1629
02:04:17,984 --> 02:04:20,384
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.

1630
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:23,115
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1631
02:04:23,222 --> 02:04:26,589
That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.

1632
02:04:26,659 --> 02:04:27,751
Yeah. Under the sink.

1633
02:04:27,827 --> 02:04:31,263
Good. What I need you two fellas to do is
take those cleaning products...

1634
02:04:31,331 --> 02:04:35,324
and clean the inside of the car.
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1635
02:04:35,435 --> 02:04:39,337
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those
little pieces of brain and skull.

1636
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:41,839
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1637
02:04:41,941 --> 02:04:45,342
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1638
02:04:45,445 --> 02:04:49,779
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.

1639
02:04:49,849 --> 02:04:53,945
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1640
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:56,454
We need to raid your linen closet.

1641
02:04:56,522 --> 02:04:59,457
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1642
02:04:59,525 --> 02:05:03,154
The thicker the better, the darker
the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1643
02:05:03,262 --> 02:05:08,529
We'll need to camouﬂage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1644
02:05:08,634 --> 02:05:10,534
with quilts and blankets...

1645
02:05:10,636 --> 02:05:14,538
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last...

1646
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:17,473
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1647
02:05:17,543 --> 02:05:19,602
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.

1648
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,442
Please would be nice.

1649
02:05:22,882 --> 02:05:25,874
- Come again?
- I said, a please would be nice.

1650
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:31,622
Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say
please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1651
02:05:33,393 --> 02:05:35,520
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess...

1652
02:05:35,628 --> 02:05:38,324
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1653
02:05:38,398 --> 02:05:42,801
I'm here to help. If my help's not
appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1654
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:45,667
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that.
Your help is definitely appreciated.

1655
02:05:45,738 --> 02:05:49,174
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1656
02:05:49,242 --> 02:05:52,075
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1657
02:05:52,178 --> 02:05:55,170
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1658
02:05:55,248 --> 02:05:59,878
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1659
02:05:59,986 --> 02:06:03,422
So pretty please,
with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1660
02:06:07,927 --> 02:06:11,055
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1661
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:16,995
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1662
02:06:19,072 --> 02:06:20,505
Green.

1663
02:06:22,608 --> 02:06:24,769
Nothin' except for the mess inside.

1664
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:30,181
About 20 minutes.

1665
02:06:31,684 --> 02:06:33,618
Nobody who'll be missed.

1666
02:06:35,688 --> 02:06:38,623
You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.

1667
02:06:39,725 --> 02:06:43,627
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good. I got it all here, but...

1668
02:06:44,964 --> 02:06:46,591
Mr. Wolf, you gotta
understand something.

1669
02:06:46,699 --> 02:06:48,394
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1670
02:06:48,468 --> 02:06:51,960
Okay. You gotta understand
something, Winston.

1671
02:06:52,071 --> 02:06:53,971
No, thank you.

1672
02:06:54,073 --> 02:06:57,201
This is our best linen here...

1673
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:02,373
and it was a wedding present
from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.

1674
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:04,780
They're not with us anymore.
I really wanna help...

1675
02:07:04,884 --> 02:07:08,445
Let me ask you a question.
If you don't mind.

1676
02:07:08,554 --> 02:07:10,215
No, no, please. Go ahead.

1677
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:16,660
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt ginny,
were they millionaires?

1678
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:19,320
No.

1679
02:07:19,432 --> 02:07:22,265
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1680
02:07:22,335 --> 02:07:25,771
And I'm positive
that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1681
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:28,272
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

1682
02:07:28,341 --> 02:07:32,607
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

1683
02:07:32,678 --> 02:07:35,841
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1684
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:43,755
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1685
02:07:44,857 --> 02:07:46,825
How about you, Jimmie?

1686
02:07:48,027 --> 02:07:49,995
You an oak man?

1687
02:07:51,097 --> 02:07:53,031
Oak's nice.

1688
02:07:58,871 --> 02:08:02,705
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1689
02:08:02,808 --> 02:08:05,208
This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.

1690
02:08:05,311 --> 02:08:08,712
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong...

1691
02:08:08,814 --> 02:08:11,715
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1692
02:08:11,817 --> 02:08:14,217
Get the fuck out my face with that shit!

1693
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,153
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1694
02:08:17,223 --> 02:08:18,656
on account of your dumb ass.

1695
02:08:18,724 --> 02:08:21,488
I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1696
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:24,826
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1697
02:08:24,897 --> 02:08:28,663
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1698
02:08:28,734 --> 02:08:30,668
That's all. I could blow.

1699
02:08:30,736 --> 02:08:32,670
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1700
02:08:32,738 --> 02:08:35,673
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1701
02:08:35,741 --> 02:08:38,676
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly TNT.

1702
02:08:38,744 --> 02:08:40,678
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1703
02:08:40,746 --> 02:08:43,180
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1704
02:08:43,249 --> 02:08:47,015
You're the motherfucker should be on brain
detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!

1705
02:08:47,086 --> 02:08:49,554
I'm washin' windows,
you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1706
02:08:59,265 --> 02:09:01,233
Fine job, gentlemen.

1707
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:04,502
You may get out of this yet.

1708
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:07,004
I can't believe this is the same car.

1709
02:09:07,073 --> 02:09:10,702
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1710
02:09:10,776 --> 02:09:14,337
Phase one is complete, clean the car,
which moves us right along to phase two.

1711
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:16,506
Clean you two.

1712
02:09:18,084 --> 02:09:19,949
Strip.

1713
02:09:20,052 --> 02:09:22,748
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1714
02:09:23,889 --> 02:09:26,915
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1715
02:09:27,026 --> 02:09:29,927
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1716
02:09:30,029 --> 02:09:32,520
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1717
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,532
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

1718
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:37,034
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1719
02:09:37,103 --> 02:09:39,435
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1720
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:43,973
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1721
02:09:48,281 --> 02:09:50,112
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1722
02:09:50,216 --> 02:09:55,244
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit
out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1723
02:09:55,321 --> 02:09:59,553
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1724
02:10:00,993 --> 02:10:02,927
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1725
02:10:02,995 --> 02:10:06,487
You both been to county before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1726
02:10:06,599 --> 02:10:09,466
- Goddamn! The waters fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1727
02:10:09,568 --> 02:10:12,765
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1728
02:10:12,838 --> 02:10:15,773
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1729
02:10:15,841 --> 02:10:18,742
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1730
02:10:18,811 --> 02:10:21,678
Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!

1731
02:10:22,782 --> 02:10:24,181
Towel.

1732
02:10:35,194 --> 02:10:38,357
You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.

1733
02:10:39,965 --> 02:10:41,762
Perfect.

1734
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:44,268
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1735
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:47,272
You guys look like...

1736
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,774
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1737
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:53,539
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1738
02:10:55,413 --> 02:10:57,004
They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

1739
02:10:57,116 --> 02:10:59,812
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

1740
02:10:59,885 --> 02:11:01,853
Don't make me beg.

1741
02:11:04,890 --> 02:11:08,326
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get our rules of the road straight.

1742
02:11:08,394 --> 02:11:10,885
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1743
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:14,966
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1744
02:11:15,034 --> 02:11:16,899
The place is North Hollywood...

1745
02:11:17,002 --> 02:11:20,995
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1746
02:11:21,073 --> 02:11:24,406
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1747
02:11:25,811 --> 02:11:27,745
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1748
02:11:27,847 --> 02:11:31,715
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

1749
02:11:31,817 --> 02:11:34,911
- Nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.
- Right.

1750
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:37,887
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1751
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:40,254
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1752
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:42,725
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1753
02:11:42,828 --> 02:11:46,229
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you keep
your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1754
02:11:46,332 --> 02:11:50,428
The gun went off.
I don't know why. I'm cool, I promise you.

1755
02:11:50,536 --> 02:11:53,437
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1756
02:11:53,539 --> 02:11:56,030
If I get my car back any
different than I gave it...

1757
02:11:56,108 --> 02:11:59,009
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1758
02:12:02,882 --> 02:12:04,577
Outta my way, Rex.

1759
02:12:06,118 --> 02:12:08,552
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1760
02:12:08,621 --> 02:12:12,387
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1761
02:12:12,458 --> 02:12:15,086
Someday all this will be hers.

1762
02:12:15,194 --> 02:12:18,027
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

1763
02:12:18,097 --> 02:12:20,463
You guys going to a volleyball game
or something?

1764
02:12:22,635 --> 02:12:24,569
I'm takin' milady out for breakfast.

1765
02:12:24,637 --> 02:12:26,867
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1766
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:28,304
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1767
02:12:28,407 --> 02:12:31,808
It's your future.

1768
02:12:31,911 --> 02:12:34,641
I see a cab ride.

1769
02:12:34,747 --> 02:12:37,716
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1770
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:40,718
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1771
02:12:40,786 --> 02:12:42,413
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.

1772
02:12:42,488 --> 02:12:46,219
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1773
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:48,954
Yeah, really. And thank
you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1774
02:12:50,296 --> 02:12:52,230
Call me Winston.

1775
02:12:53,799 --> 02:12:56,734
You see that, young lady? Respect.

1776
02:12:56,802 --> 02:13:00,966
- Respect for one's elders shows character.
- I have character.

1777
02:13:01,073 --> 02:13:05,066
Because you are a character doesn't
mean that you have character.

1778
02:13:12,651 --> 02:13:14,619
Wanna share a cab?

1779
02:13:14,687 --> 02:13:18,953
I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1780
02:13:19,024 --> 02:13:20,321
Cool.

1781
02:13:25,831 --> 02:13:28,959
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1782
02:13:29,034 --> 02:13:31,127
Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.

1783
02:13:31,203 --> 02:13:33,467
- I know that now.
- But was he cool or what?

1784
02:13:33,539 --> 02:13:37,475
- Thank you.
- Totally fuckin' cool, in control.

1785
02:13:37,543 --> 02:13:41,604
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him. I was amazed.

1786
02:13:42,681 --> 02:13:44,273
Want some bacon?

1787
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:47,114
- No, man, I don't eat pork.
- Are you Jewish?

1788
02:13:47,186 --> 02:13:49,780
I ain't Jewish. I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

1789
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:52,790
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1790
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:54,792
I don't eat filthy animals.

1791
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:58,296
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1792
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:01,299
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1793
02:14:01,367 --> 02:14:03,130
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1794
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:07,305
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1795
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:11,036
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense
enough to disregard its own feces.

1796
02:14:11,143 --> 02:14:13,668
How about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.

1797
02:14:13,746 --> 02:14:15,680
I don't eat dog either.

1798
02:14:15,748 --> 02:14:19,081
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1799
02:14:19,184 --> 02:14:21,812
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy...

1800
02:14:21,887 --> 02:14:23,684
but they're definitely dirty.

1801
02:14:23,756 --> 02:14:26,725
But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.

1802
02:14:26,825 --> 02:14:28,315
So, by that rationale...

1803
02:14:28,394 --> 02:14:32,728
if a pig had a better personality, he would
cease to be a filthy animal, is that true?

1804
02:14:32,831 --> 02:14:35,925
We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1805
02:14:36,035 --> 02:14:40,062
I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more
charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1806
02:14:45,678 --> 02:14:47,771
Oh, man, that's good.

1807
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:51,441
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1808
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:53,950
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1809
02:14:54,053 --> 02:14:57,022
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1810
02:14:57,089 --> 02:14:58,556
About the miracle we witnessed.

1811
02:14:58,624 --> 02:15:01,923
Miracle you witnessed.
I witnessed a freak occurrence.

1812
02:15:02,027 --> 02:15:03,358
What is a miracle, Vincent?

1813
02:15:05,297 --> 02:15:08,460
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1814
02:15:11,971 --> 02:15:15,805
When God makes
the impossible possible.

1815
02:15:16,809 --> 02:15:18,743
But this morning...

1816
02:15:18,811 --> 02:15:21,541
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1817
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:25,311
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1818
02:15:25,417 --> 02:15:30,320
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1819
02:15:30,422 --> 02:15:33,391
You don't judge shit
like this based on merit.

1820
02:15:33,459 --> 02:15:35,927
Now, whether or not what we experienced...

1821
02:15:35,995 --> 02:15:39,123
was an 'According to Hoyle'
miracle is insignificant.

1822
02:15:39,231 --> 02:15:42,962
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1823
02:15:43,068 --> 02:15:44,968
God got involved.

1824
02:15:45,070 --> 02:15:46,765
But why?

1825
02:15:46,839 --> 02:15:49,899
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me.
I don't know why.

1826
02:15:49,975 --> 02:15:52,944
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1827
02:15:53,012 --> 02:15:54,912
You're really thinkin' about quittin'.

1828
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:57,642
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1829
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:01,083
Fuck. What you gonna do then?

1830
02:16:02,421 --> 02:16:06,619
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1831
02:16:06,692 --> 02:16:10,287
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1832
02:16:10,362 --> 02:16:13,456
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1833
02:16:13,532 --> 02:16:16,968
- What you mean, walk the Earth?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1834
02:16:17,036 --> 02:16:20,005
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1835
02:16:20,105 --> 02:16:22,335
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1836
02:16:22,441 --> 02:16:25,706
- 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.
- What if he don't do that?

1837
02:16:25,811 --> 02:16:28,177
If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.

1838
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:30,714
So you decided to be a bum.

1839
02:16:30,816 --> 02:16:34,445
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1840
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,488
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum...

1841
02:16:36,555 --> 02:16:39,854
just like all those pieces of shit out
there who beg for change...

1842
02:16:39,958 --> 02:16:42,859
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1843
02:16:42,961 --> 02:16:45,896
They got a name for that, Jules,
it's called a bum.

1844
02:16:45,998 --> 02:16:49,661
And without a job, a residence or legal
tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1845
02:16:49,735 --> 02:16:51,635
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1846
02:16:51,704 --> 02:16:54,639
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1847
02:16:54,707 --> 02:16:57,540
Garcon! Coffee!

1848
02:16:57,643 --> 02:17:02,137
Jules, look what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1849
02:17:02,214 --> 02:17:05,308
- But water into wine, I...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1850
02:17:05,384 --> 02:17:08,512
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you...

1851
02:17:08,587 --> 02:17:11,147
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1852
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:15,993
I'm gonna take a shit.

1853
02:17:19,865 --> 02:17:21,389
Let me ask you something.

1854
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:24,867
When did you make this decision, when you
were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1855
02:17:24,937 --> 02:17:28,873
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin,
drinkin' my coffee...

1856
02:17:28,941 --> 02:17:30,875
replayin' the incident in my head...

1857
02:17:30,943 --> 02:17:34,777
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1858
02:17:35,414 --> 02:17:37,939
Fuck. To be continued.

1859
02:17:49,962 --> 02:17:52,931
- I love you, pumpkin.
- I love you, honey bunny.

1860
02:17:54,533 --> 02:17:56,592
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1861
02:17:56,702 --> 02:17:59,296
Any one of you fucking pricks move...

1862
02:17:59,404 --> 02:18:02,532
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1863
02:18:02,608 --> 02:18:05,975
You got that?
You just be quiet over there!

1864
02:18:06,078 --> 02:18:09,104
Get on the fuckin'... get the fuck down!

1865
02:18:09,214 --> 02:18:13,913
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames
over to that booth, on the count of ten!

1866
02:18:13,986 --> 02:18:18,548
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1867
02:18:18,624 --> 02:18:21,718
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1868
02:18:21,794 --> 02:18:24,262
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1869
02:18:24,329 --> 02:18:26,820
Fucking move! Move!

1870
02:18:26,932 --> 02:18:29,162
Move! Get the fuck...

1871
02:18:29,268 --> 02:18:32,260
Get down on the fucking floor!

1872
02:18:32,337 --> 02:18:34,271
Grandpa! Down!

1873
02:18:34,339 --> 02:18:37,740
I'm the manager here,
and there's no problem. No problem at all.

1874
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:40,745
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1875
02:18:40,813 --> 02:18:44,806
Thought you said you were gonna give me
a fucking problem!

1876
02:18:44,917 --> 02:18:49,581
- I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1877
02:18:50,189 --> 02:18:51,952
I am not a hero.

1878
02:18:52,024 --> 02:18:54,686
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1879
02:18:54,793 --> 02:18:56,522
The restaurant's ours!

1880
02:18:56,628 --> 02:18:59,529
Just take whatever you want.

1881
02:18:59,631 --> 02:19:01,531
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1882
02:19:01,633 --> 02:19:04,761
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1883
02:19:04,837 --> 02:19:06,805
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1884
02:19:09,107 --> 02:19:12,975
Listen, everybody. Be calm, cooperate...

1885
02:19:13,045 --> 02:19:15,980
and this'll all be over in a minute!

1886
02:19:16,048 --> 02:19:18,039
Get the fuck down! Well done.

1887
02:19:30,362 --> 02:19:33,820
All right, now, people, gonna come around
and collect your wallets!

1888
02:19:33,899 --> 02:19:37,335
You don't fucking talk, you just throw 'em
in the bag! Are we clear?

1889
02:19:37,402 --> 02:19:39,666
I said, are we fucking clear?

1890
02:19:39,738 --> 02:19:41,638
Good! Now, wallets out!

1891
02:19:43,342 --> 02:19:46,334
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1892
02:19:46,411 --> 02:19:49,346
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1893
02:19:49,414 --> 02:19:51,245
In the bag.

1894
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:54,245
What am I waiting for? In the fucking bag.

1895
02:19:54,353 --> 02:19:57,254
Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.

1896
02:19:58,090 --> 02:19:59,557
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1897
02:19:59,658 --> 02:20:01,182
In the fucking bag.

1898
02:20:03,161 --> 02:20:06,597
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1899
02:20:06,698 --> 02:20:09,098
In the bag. In the bag.

1900
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,248
In the bag.

1901
02:20:38,363 --> 02:20:41,264
- What's in the case?
- My boss' dirty laundry.

1902
02:20:41,366 --> 02:20:43,891
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1903
02:20:43,969 --> 02:20:46,631
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1904
02:20:46,738 --> 02:20:49,639
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1905
02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:54,042
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1906
02:20:55,147 --> 02:20:57,445
What's going on?

1907
02:20:57,549 --> 02:20:59,414
Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.

1908
02:20:59,484 --> 02:21:00,974
Shoot him in the face!

1909
02:21:01,086 --> 02:21:04,783
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't
the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1910
02:21:04,890 --> 02:21:07,256
If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

1911
02:21:07,326 --> 02:21:08,588
Stop causing problems!

1912
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:11,128
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em what
you got and get 'em outta here!

1913
02:21:11,229 --> 02:21:15,427
Shut the fuck up, fat man!
This ain't none of your goddamn business!

1914
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:17,764
Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.

1915
02:21:17,836 --> 02:21:19,895
No problem. I got it under control.

1916
02:21:21,506 --> 02:21:23,497
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1917
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:29,012
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1918
02:21:33,452 --> 02:21:34,851
We clear?

1919
02:21:38,523 --> 02:21:40,457
One.

1920
02:21:42,294 --> 02:21:44,785
Two.

1921
02:21:44,863 --> 02:21:46,922
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1922
02:21:46,999 --> 02:21:49,092
You win.

1923
02:21:49,167 --> 02:21:51,101
It's yours.

1924
02:21:56,141 --> 02:21:57,870
Open it.

1925
02:22:01,713 --> 02:22:03,943
Hey, what is it?

1926
02:22:04,016 --> 02:22:06,348
What is it?

1927
02:22:06,451 --> 02:22:09,045
Is that what I think it is?

1928
02:22:13,392 --> 02:22:15,485
It's beautiful.

1929
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:18,120
Goddamn it, what is it?

1930
02:22:19,631 --> 02:22:22,532
You let him go! You let him go!

1931
02:22:22,634 --> 02:22:25,569
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1932
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:28,571
- Say, bitch, be cool! Say, bitch, be cool!
- Be cool! Be cool!

1933
02:22:28,673 --> 02:22:31,369
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1934
02:22:31,476 --> 02:22:34,343
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1935
02:22:34,413 --> 02:22:36,210
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1936
02:22:36,314 --> 02:22:39,215
- Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1937
02:22:39,317 --> 02:22:41,182
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1938
02:22:41,253 --> 02:22:43,187
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1939
02:22:43,255 --> 02:22:46,691
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

1940
02:22:46,758 --> 02:22:49,693
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1941
02:22:49,761 --> 02:22:53,253
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1942
02:22:53,365 --> 02:22:57,028
- Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1943
02:22:57,102 --> 02:22:59,002
- What?
- Cool.

1944
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:01,904
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1945
02:23:02,007 --> 02:23:03,907
We're gonna be cool.

1946
02:23:04,009 --> 02:23:08,878
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.

1947
02:23:08,947 --> 02:23:11,040
And when I count three...

1948
02:23:11,116 --> 02:23:14,051
I want you to let go of your gun...

1949
02:23:14,119 --> 02:23:17,611
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1950
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:20,715
And when you do it...

1951
02:23:20,792 --> 02:23:22,885
you do it cool.

1952
02:23:22,961 --> 02:23:25,259
You ready?

1953
02:23:25,363 --> 02:23:27,422
One...

1954
02:23:27,532 --> 02:23:29,727
two...

1955
02:23:29,801 --> 02:23:31,735
three.

1956
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:41,804
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1957
02:23:41,913 --> 02:23:45,474
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1958
02:23:45,584 --> 02:23:47,643
When I get nervous, I get scared.

1959
02:23:47,752 --> 02:23:51,552
When motherfuckers get scared, that's when
motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1960
02:23:53,225 --> 02:23:56,820
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1961
02:23:56,928 --> 02:24:00,295
Well, that seems to be the situation.

1962
02:24:00,398 --> 02:24:02,298
But I don't want that.

1963
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,300
And you don't want that.

1964
02:24:04,402 --> 02:24:07,098
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1965
02:24:07,172 --> 02:24:09,299
So let's see what we can do.

1966
02:24:11,109 --> 02:24:14,943
Now here's the situation.

1967
02:24:15,013 --> 02:24:18,847
Normally both your asses
would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...

1968
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:21,851
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period...

1969
02:24:21,953 --> 02:24:24,353
and I don't wanna kill you.
I wanna help you.

1970
02:24:24,456 --> 02:24:29,189
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1971
02:24:29,294 --> 02:24:32,354
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1972
02:24:32,464 --> 02:24:35,365
to just hand it over to your dumb ass.

1973
02:24:35,467 --> 02:24:37,298
Vincent!

1974
02:24:37,369 --> 02:24:40,304
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1975
02:24:40,372 --> 02:24:43,102
It's cool! We still just talkin'.

1976
02:24:43,175 --> 02:24:46,611
Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me.

1977
02:24:46,678 --> 02:24:49,476
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1978
02:24:49,548 --> 02:24:51,482
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1979
02:24:51,550 --> 02:24:53,484
Tell her it's still cool.

1980
02:24:53,552 --> 02:24:56,453
- It's still cool, honey bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1981
02:24:57,889 --> 02:25:00,517
I gotta go pee.

1982
02:25:00,625 --> 02:25:02,525
I wanna go home.

1983
02:25:02,627 --> 02:25:06,188
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1984
02:25:06,298 --> 02:25:09,199
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1985
02:25:09,301 --> 02:25:12,634
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

1986
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:14,569
I love you too, honey bunny.

1987
02:25:14,673 --> 02:25:19,906
Now, I want you to go
in that bag and find my wallet.

1988
02:25:22,414 --> 02:25:25,975
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says bad motherfucker.

1989
02:25:40,665 --> 02:25:44,032
That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.

1990
02:25:44,102 --> 02:25:46,400
Open it up. Take out the money.

1991
02:25:51,943 --> 02:25:53,604
Count it.

1992
02:25:59,918 --> 02:26:02,443
How much is there?

1993
02:26:04,356 --> 02:26:06,256
About 1,500 dollars.

1994
02:26:06,358 --> 02:26:09,521
Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.

1995
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:12,791
Now, with the rest of those wallets
and the register...

1996
02:26:12,897 --> 02:26:14,956
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1997
02:26:15,066 --> 02:26:17,193
Jules, you give that
fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars...

1998
02:26:17,269 --> 02:26:18,930
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

1999
02:26:19,037 --> 02:26:21,938
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2000
02:26:22,040 --> 02:26:24,600
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2001
02:26:24,709 --> 02:26:28,577
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2002
02:26:28,647 --> 02:26:31,582
Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.

2003
02:26:31,650 --> 02:26:33,550
I'm buyin' something for my money.

2004
02:26:34,819 --> 02:26:37,982
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

2005
02:26:38,089 --> 02:26:42,788
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2006
02:26:42,894 --> 02:26:45,556
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2007
02:26:46,665 --> 02:26:48,599
Not regularly, no.

2008
02:26:48,667 --> 02:26:51,067
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2009
02:26:51,136 --> 02:26:54,663
Ezekiel 25:17.

2010
02:26:54,773 --> 02:26:58,004
The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2011
02:26:58,109 --> 02:27:01,567
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

2012
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:05,013
Blessed is he who in the name of charity
and good will...

2013
02:27:05,116 --> 02:27:07,516
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness...

2014
02:27:07,619 --> 02:27:11,680
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2015
02:27:11,790 --> 02:27:16,090
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2016
02:27:16,161 --> 02:27:19,187
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2017
02:27:19,297 --> 02:27:22,289
And you will know I am the Lord...

2018
02:27:22,367 --> 02:27:25,029
when I lay my vengeance upon you.

2019
02:27:27,038 --> 02:27:29,472
I been sayin' that shit for years...

2020
02:27:29,541 --> 02:27:32,669
and if you heard it, that meant your ass.

2021
02:27:32,777 --> 02:27:35,678
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2022
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:38,681
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2023
02:27:38,783 --> 02:27:41,183
before I popped a cap in his ass.

2024
02:27:41,286 --> 02:27:43,686
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2025
02:27:44,789 --> 02:27:47,690
See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...

2026
02:27:47,792 --> 02:27:52,661
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man...

2027
02:27:52,731 --> 02:27:55,666
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2028
02:27:55,734 --> 02:27:59,295
protecting my righteous ass
in the Valley of Darkness.

2029
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:01,305
Or it could mean...

2030
02:28:01,373 --> 02:28:04,809
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd...

2031
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:08,812
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2032
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,144
Yeah, I'd like that.

2033
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:14,083
But that shit ain't the truth.

2034
02:28:14,185 --> 02:28:16,050
The truth is...

2035
02:28:17,088 --> 02:28:19,750
you're the weak...

2036
02:28:20,425 --> 02:28:23,826
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2037
02:28:25,263 --> 02:28:27,197
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2038
02:28:28,433 --> 02:28:33,097
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2039
02:28:49,053 --> 02:28:50,953
Go.

2040
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:11,108
I think we should be leaving now.

2041
02:29:11,876 --> 02:29:13,605
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
