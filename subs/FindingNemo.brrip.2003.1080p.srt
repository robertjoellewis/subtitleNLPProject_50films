87
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,688

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That snail was about to charge.</font></b>

98

99

104
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,617

Tell us a joke.</font></b>

are no funnier than any other fish.</font></b>

110
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,841
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Clowny.

He walks up to...</font></b>

It is a party.</font></b>

320
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:59,406
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind your distance, though. Those
balloons can be a bit dodgy.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If I am to change this image,
I must first change myself.</font></b>

333
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,706
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fish are friends, not food.</font></b>

334
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,416
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Except stinking dolphins.</font></b>

335
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,377
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dolphins! Yeah, they
think they're so cute.</font></b>

336
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,590
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin. Let
me flip for you. Ain't I something?</font></b>

337
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,218
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today's meeting is step 5
Bring a Fish Friend.</font></b>

338

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Help yourself to
one of my friends.</font></b>

344
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:23,114
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, mate. A
little chum for Chum.</font></b>
