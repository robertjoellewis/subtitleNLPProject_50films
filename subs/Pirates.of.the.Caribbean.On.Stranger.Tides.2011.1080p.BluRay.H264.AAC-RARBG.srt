1
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,421
Who are you?

2
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,604
What is this?

3
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:37,271
Our Majesty, caught him up
in a fishing net. A fishing net.

4
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,360
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...

5
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,399
We believe he's found a...

6
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,330
Ponce de Leon.

7
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,789
Says he found Ponce de Leon's ship.

8
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:58,674
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

9
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:01,086
Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago.

10
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:04,756
Ah, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

11
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,185
The Fountain of Youth.

12
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,059
How soon can you sail?

13
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,488
With the tide.

14
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,794
Over here Lucky heather.

15
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,009
Pirate swords. Pirate swords.

16
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,547
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing.

17
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,557
Pirate puppets.

18
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,217
Take that, you.

19
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,182
Hurry, Papa, or we will miss the hanging.

20
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:55,019
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

21
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,808
Pirate hanging today.

22
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,647
Come on. Up you get.

23
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,524
Move along, pirate.

24
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,074
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

25
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,454
Come on. Come on. Up you go.

26
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,458
Quiet. Order.

27
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,329
Quiet.

28
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,915
Now appearing before the court,

29
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:23,301
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

30
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,837
and highwayman... Quiet.

31
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,676
...Captain Jack Sparrow.

32
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,429
I told you, the name's Gibbs.
Joshamee Gibbs.

33
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:36,394
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye.

34
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:37,853
Presiding over these trials,

35
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:43,614
all rise and attend,
the Right Honorable Justice Smith.

36
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,158
My dear sir.

37
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,087
Quiet.

38
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,480
Now...

39
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,094
...what do we have here?

40
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:08,550
Jack?

41
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,181
Shut up.

42
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:11,971
I don't recognize him.

43
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:15,308
Not necessary. You were saying?

44
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:18,098
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

45
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,141
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

46
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,026
Is that so?

47
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:25,189
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told them.

48
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,484
I am not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court

49
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:31,529
if it would help my case.
I think that would be a poor defense,

50
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,368
unless you want to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

51
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
The prisoner claims of being innocent

52
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,204
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

53
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,082
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

54
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:45,751
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

55
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,760
Guilty verdict means he will hang.

56
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,598
Hang him. String him up.

57
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,387
- Guilty?
- That's not fair.

58
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:57,771
Shut it.

59
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,813
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which
you have been found guilty of

60
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:05,695
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

61
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,231
I hereby commute your sentence,

62
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:11,026
and order that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

63
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:14,037
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

64
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,118
- What?
- Hang him.

65
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,453
- Hang him.
- There.

66
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,953
- Balderdash.
- String him up. Hang him high.

67
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,248
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

68
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:27,418
to the Tower of London.

69
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,222
Thanks very much.

70
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,814
Ta.

71
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,241
Come on. Get up there.

72
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,370
Get up.

73
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,705
Hell's teeth.
Now we're both headed for prison.

74
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,545
Not to worry.
I have paid off the driver.

75
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:11,052
Ten minutes, we will be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

76
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:12,712
Tonight, we make the coast.

77
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,223
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

78
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,135
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

79
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:21,225
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

80
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:24,516
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs
from one appointment with the gallows.

81
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,434
Seeing as how you're still alive,

82
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:29,320
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

83
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,193
What happened to you, Gibbs?

84
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:33,905
I thought you were employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

85
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:37,537
Aye. But I always listened like a thief
for news of the Black Pearl..

86
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:40,119
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

87
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,329
Then, I hear a rumor:

88
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,962
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and looking for a crew.

89
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:47,838
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

90
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,216
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

91
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:51,877
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

92
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:55,263
- Am not.
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

93
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:59,096
but then, you have never been
the most predictable of sorts.

94
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,261
Tell me something.

95
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,931
There is another Jack Sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

96
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,226
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

97
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:11,113
But... an impostor with a ship.

98
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:13,819
And in need of a crew.

99
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,985
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

100
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,619
What about you, Jack?

101
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:22,624
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.

102
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:24,284
Any luck?

103
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,293
Circumstances arose
and forced a compelling insight

104
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,423
regarding discretion and valor.

105
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:34,677
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.

106
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:37,635
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

107
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:42,599
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

108
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,389
Short trip.

109
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,363
All part of the plan, yes?

110
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,576
No.

111
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,085
You are Jack Sparrow?

112
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,792
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

113
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,461
I have heard of you.

114
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:41,675
And you know who I am.

115
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,262
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

116
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:49,179
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-uneburg,

117
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,190
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

118
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,727
King of Great Britain and Ireland,
and of you.

119
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,572
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

120
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:04,156
you have come to London
to procure a crew for your ship.

121
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,454
Vicious rumor. Not true.

122
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:09,707
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

123
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:13,086
I am Jack Sparrow,
but I am not here to procure a crew.

124
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,622
That is... someone else.

125
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,335
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

126
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,258
You have brought me the wrong wastrel.

127
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:26,675
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

128
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,889
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

129
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,429
I am Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

130
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,269
And I am in London.

131
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,479
To procure a crew.

132
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,314
To undertake a voyage....

133
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:38,898
....to the Fountain...
What?

134
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:43,612
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

135
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:44,901
Come, come.

136
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,781
We know you're in possession of a map.

137
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:53,076
So confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him.

138
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:55,085
Have you a map?

139
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,461
- No.
- Where is it?

140
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:06,302
The truth? I lost it.

141
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:10,435
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

142
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:14,189
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

143
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,444
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

144
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:24,199
a Catholic, gain eternal life.

145
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,695
You do know the way to the Fountain?

146
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,989
Of course I do.
Look at me.

147
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:32,998
You could guide an expedition.

148
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,666
With your permission, your heinie,

149
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,206
you will be providing, then, a ship...

150
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,467
...and a crew?

151
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:46,129
And a captain.

152
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,988
Afternoon, sire.

153
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,369
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not in chains?

154
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,404
He must be manacled at once.

155
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:15,166
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

156
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,906
"Hector."

157
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,088
How nice to see a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

158
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:24,376
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

159
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:30,094
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.

160
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:33,726
As may be, but first,

161
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,057
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

162
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:39,315
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

163
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,726
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

164
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:45,772
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

165
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,915
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

166
00:13:55,915 --> 00:14:01,330
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

167
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,920
I have every confidence
you will prevail and be rewarded

168
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,380
with the high station you so desire.

169
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,299
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

170
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,768
Jack, our sands be all but run.

171
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:19,226
Where's the harm
in joining the winning side?

172
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:23,143
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

173
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:25,687
I understand everything.

174
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,406
Except that wig.

175
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,869
He's getting away. Stop him.

176
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:41,628
- Head him off.
- No. Stop that pirate.

177
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,600
Come down.

178
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,285
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

179
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,131
Guards. Guards.

180
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,403
- Arms at ready.
- Aye, sir.

181
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,865
Find him.

182
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,597
Finders keepers.

183
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:25,981
There.

184
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,794
Is that it?

185
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,467
Halt. Stop that carriage.

186
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:58,882
Head him off.

187
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,525
Out of the way.

188
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,550
Stop that pirate.

189
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,262
Move out of the way.

190
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,232
Stop that man.

191
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:52,902
Don't let him get away.

192
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,153
Fire.

193
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,776
He's getting away.
After him. Stop him.

194
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,647
After him.

195
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,418
Filthy pirate.

196
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,676
Hello, Jackie.

197
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,890
Hello, Dad.

198
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,479
I heard you're putting together a crew.

199
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:21,491
If enough people keep saying it,
it must be true.

200
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,403
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

201
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:26,036
Have you been there?

202
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,207
Does this face look like
it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

203
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,834
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.

204
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,795
There will be items required
for the profane ritual.

205
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,584
Two chalices.

206
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,756
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.

207
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:47,767
From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You will need both.

208
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:51,521
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

209
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:54,728
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

210
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,733
Oh, set sail. Love to.

211
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:59,111
But for that, I may need a ship.

212
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:02,523
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

213
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:05,239
They're signing up sailors right now.

214
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,574
My heart is pierced by Cupid

215
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,704
I disdain all glittering gold

216
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:12,207
And one last thing, Jackie.

217
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,920
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

218
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,376
My heart is pierced by Cupid

219
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,462
I disdain all glittering gold

220
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:23,343
There is nothing can console me

221
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:26,096
But my jolly sailor bold

222
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,445
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

223
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:43,651
Aye. That is,

224
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:47,569
Jack Sparrow be putting together
a modest venture.

225
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,659
You got some nerve, ain't you?

226
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,324
Turning up here dressed like that?

227
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:55,458
What are you, some kind of impostor?

228
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,790
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

229
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,586
Oi, muckers.

230
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,343
There's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name.

231
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,390
Lads, I am sailing with Sparrow.

232
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,300
Who will buy a sailor a drink?

233
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,928
Who's "next"?

234
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,444
Bring us some more of those ones.

235
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:28,780
Yeah, make it four.

236
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,380
You have stolen me,
and I am here to take meself back.

237
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,165
Stop doing that.

238
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,131
Only one person alive knows that move.

239
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,015
Always wanted to do that.

240
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,730
Hello, Angelica.

241
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:10,021
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

242
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:13,362
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

243
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:17,574
I am touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

244
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,248
But why?

245
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,034
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

246
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,919
That is not a compliment.

247
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:32,002
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

248
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:37,299
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

249
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:41,344
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

250
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:45,014
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

251
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:49,185
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.

252
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:53,026
There is one peculiarity
with which I will not put up with.

253
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,738
I will be impersonated as "Captain."
Nothing less.

254
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,903
Well, for that, you need a ship,

255
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:01,538
and as it turns out, I have one.

256
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,412
I could use a ship.

257
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:07,293
I hear tell you have been to the Fountain.

258
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:09,580
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

259
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,252
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

260
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:17,137
You still have a few usable years left.

261
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,633
Always so charming.

262
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:21,891
You didn't answer me.

263
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:24,599
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

264
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,357
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

265
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:31,143
Wretched pirates. Find them. Maggots.

266
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,524
Friends of yours?

267
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:39,318
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

268
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:41,236
Open it.

269
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:44,031
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

270
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:45,540
Yes.

271
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,372
Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

272
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:50,879
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.

273
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:52,756
I was innocent of the ways of men.

274
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:56,168
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.

275
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:59,088
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady.

276
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:00,802
Open it.

277
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:04,560
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

278
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,346
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

279
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:10,231
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

280
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,813
- There he is.
- Over there.

281
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,170
We are at a disadvantage.

282
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,712
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be,

283
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:41,630
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

284
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,219
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

285
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,009
How can you say I used you?

286
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,344
You know exactly how.

287
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,602
I know, but how can you say it?

288
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,769
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

289
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,437
About the Fountain.

290
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,065
What do you know?

291
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,615
You don't happen to be in possession

292
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:48,997
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de Leon?

293
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,582
- No.
- Thought not.

294
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:55,337
- Why?
- I hear stories.

295
00:27:55,337 --> 00:27:57,293
Rumors.

296
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,583
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

297
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,627
Yes, I am.

298
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,723
What is it?
What is required?

299
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,312
A mermaid, Jack.

300
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,690
There's been a mistake.

301
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,360
It's a life sentence, not death. Life.

302
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,123
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

303
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:38,255
I trust you can tie a noose.

304
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,790
That's a hard thing,

305
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,926
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

306
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,592
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

307
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,808
What's happened to you?

308
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:53,345
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

309
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:54,933
I am on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

310
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,440
The HMS Providence
sets sail at first light.

311
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,727
If you do not care to watch it
hanging here dead,

312
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:01,896
with a mouth full of flies...

313
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,190
...speak now.

314
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,411
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

315
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:14,371
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

316
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:17,536
Is that where Jack be headed?

317
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:21,707
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

318
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:23,375
Anything at all?

319
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,680
Upon me naked word,
you will not see the dawn.

320
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,439
Hand it over.

321
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,481
- You fool.
- I had just enough time

322
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:48,116
to study those infernal circles.

323
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:52,906
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.

324
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:58,411
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy,
Master Gibbs.

325
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,516
Show a leg, sailor.

326
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,893
Aye, sir.

327
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,725
What?

328
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:21,062
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

329
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,524
- I am not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

330
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,610
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

331
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,991
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

332
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:31,652
and drank away all his bonus money.

333
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:33,786
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

334
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:36,323
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

335
00:30:36,323 --> 00:30:39,038
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.

336
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,006
Scrum.

337
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:51,388
Get your elbows in.

338
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,766
Why is there a glass coffin?

339
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,349
Do I look like a man in charge?

340
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:01,435
- Where am I?
- Excuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

341
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:03,225
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard

342
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:06,645
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen Anne's Revenge.

343
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,692
Blackbeard.

344
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,926
Work.

345
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,476
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

346
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,262
Zombiefied.

347
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:43,898
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.

348
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:45,775
Makes them more compliant.

349
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,028
And perpetually ill-tempered.

350
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,324
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

351
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:04,040
Pull. Pull. Pull.

352
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,130
Five days underway, at least.

353
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,092
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

354
00:32:15,092 --> 00:32:16,973
Smell of the crew.

355
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,647
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

356
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,808
And how can I make sure to not?

357
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:28,272
Him? Churchly fellow.

358
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:30,438
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

359
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:32,321
Bible-thumper on this ship?

360
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,357
A missionary is his story.

361
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:37,243
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

362
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:40,247
Rest of the ship got killed,
but not him.

363
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:41,702
First mate wouldn't let it happen

364
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:44,539
on account of his premier standing
with the Lord.

365
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:49,082
A first mate sticking her neck out
for some prisoner.

366
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:50,840
That you don't see.

367
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,673
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?

368
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:55,053
Back to work.

369
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,606
Steady as she goes.

370
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:25,208
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

371
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:28,836
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

372
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:31,794
upon which I am now imprisoned.

373
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,924
We can do this, Jack.

374
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:38,634
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

375
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:43,893
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

376
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:46,180
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

377
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,191
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

378
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:52,228
Maybe to his own daughter?

379
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,691
Daughter as in... beget by?

380
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,408
Long-lost. Recently found.

381
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:06,370
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

382
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,581
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

383
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,840
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

384
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,847
or him and you, not you and me.

385
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:23,053
No, Jack, that's the best part.

386
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:25,264
He will be dead.

387
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,972
You will be handling
that part yourself, then?

388
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:31,357
There is a prophecy.

389
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:33,689
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

390
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:36,320
Oh, no, no.
I have seen a thing or two.

391
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,869
The prophecy is this:

392
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,827
Blackbeard will meet his death
within a fortnight

393
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:50,415
at the hands of a one-legged man.

394
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:52,750
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

395
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,849
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

396
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:15,064
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

397
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,944
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

398
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:24,532
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

399
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:26,788
And in the king's name,
we behave as such.

400
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:29,745
Aye, Captain.

401
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,956
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

402
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:40,719
Aye, it be proper.
There's your proof.

403
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,510
The Spaniard.

404
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:54,816
All hands. Battle stations.
Get to windward.

405
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:58,023
- All hands, windward.
- Harden up two points.

406
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:01,611
- Two points.
- Cast loose the cannons.

407
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:09,331
- Gunners, take posts.
- Take position. Gunners ready, sir.

408
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:13,335
- Out. Thrust.
- Await orders.

409
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:16,796
Steady.

410
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,757
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

411
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,096
Sir. Orders, sir?

412
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,442
He never so much as turned his head.

413
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:40,444
The Fountain is the prize.

414
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:44,199
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

415
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:48,237
And now we have fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail.

416
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:50,952
All hands, more sail.

417
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:54,414
Ride hard between wind and tide.

418
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:08,015
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

419
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,550
Mutiny most foul.

420
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,221
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

421
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:15,639
And a lady, at that.

422
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,978
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

423
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:20,485
Make my toes curl, they do.

424
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:23,692
I got them. All of them.

425
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,778
- Well done.
- Good lad.

426
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:28,364
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

427
00:37:28,364 --> 00:37:30,950
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

428
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,866
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

429
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:37,206
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

430
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,546
He must come out sometime.

431
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,629
Not really, no.

432
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,174
Any of you sail with him before?

433
00:37:47,174 --> 00:37:48,758
- No, no.
- I have never.

434
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:49,922
Definitely not.

435
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:53,935
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

436
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,726
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

437
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,892
no one's seen him...

438
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:03,061
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

439
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:05,025
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

440
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:07,191
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge,
right enough.

441
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:08,778
How do you know?

442
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:12,195
I have seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

443
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,420
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

444
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,257
...you have been monstrously deceived.

445
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:28,545
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

446
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:31,590
You have nay been informed
of a destination.

447
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,884
Death lies before us

448
00:38:33,884 --> 00:38:38,852
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

449
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,354
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

450
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:46,613
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

451
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:50,116
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

452
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:52,777
...we take the ship.

453
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,615
We take the ship, then. Now.

454
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,371
Go on, then.

455
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,791
- Help me, shipmates.
- Give it to them.

456
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,177
- Wake up. It's ours.
- Come on.

457
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:11,962
Get up. Off your backside.

458
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,891
- Get off your fannies.
- Take it to them, lads.

459
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:16,847
Help me. Fight.

460
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,816
Jack.

461
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:38,081
If this is a dream,
you can keep the sword and boots on.

462
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,744
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

463
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,421
No, it's not.

464
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,300
I thought I should give you
fair warning, we're taking the ship.

465
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,840
Nothing personal.

466
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,801
Think you might be better off
if you just...

467
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,766
...stay out of it.

468
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,666
Boggit.

469
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,561
Wretch.

470
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,183
You're either with us or against us.

471
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:23,515
I am not with you,
neither am I against you.

472
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,021
Can he do that?

473
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:28,183
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

474
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,821
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes.

475
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,039
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight.

476
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,521
The ship is ours.

477
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,594
Gentlemen.

478
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,522
I be placed in a bewilderment.

479
00:42:49,522 --> 00:42:54,311
There I were, resting,

480
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:59,108
and upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.

481
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,116
Sailors abandon their posts

482
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:06,781
without orders, without leave.

483
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,127
Men before the mast,

484
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,663
taking the ship for themselves.

485
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,712
What be that, First Mate?

486
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:20,720
- Mutiny, Captain.
- Again?

487
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,848
- Mutiny.
- Aye.

488
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,096
Mutiny.

489
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:32,061
And what fate befalls mutineers?

490
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:35,727
Now, we know the answer to that,
do we not?

491
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:39,443
Mutineers hang.

492
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,998
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

493
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,126
I can name fingers and point names.

494
00:44:34,126 --> 00:44:35,753
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

495
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:39,131
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

496
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,718
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter you have?

497
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,805
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

498
00:44:49,805 --> 00:44:52,345
Remember, Father.
We need him.

499
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:53,979
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,

500
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:56,516
they forget who I am. Coward.

501
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,312
They do not forget.

502
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:02,855
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

503
00:45:02,855 --> 00:45:05,320
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

504
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,860
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.

505
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,155
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

506
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,161
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

507
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:17,545
No, sir. The truth is
it be much simpler than all that.

508
00:45:17,545 --> 00:45:20,582
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

509
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:22,716
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

510
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:25,469
- No.
- All Latin blood like her mother.

511
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:27,676
Father, I beg you.

512
00:45:27,676 --> 00:45:31,559
There I be again,
forgetting why the missionary is here.

513
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,098
My daughter fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

514
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,769
You truly wish to save me, my child?

515
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:42,858
Every soul can be saved.

516
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,781
Be that true, young cleric?

517
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:49,615
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

518
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:54,578
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

519
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,787
You disarm me with your faith.

520
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,627
Eight bells.

521
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:05,760
Which of you unfortunate souls
stood watch?

522
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,890
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

523
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,639
You?

524
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,940
Aye.

525
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,268
Aye.

526
00:46:22,268 --> 00:46:24,402
The cook.

527
00:46:24,402 --> 00:46:27,406
Perfect. Lower the longboat.

528
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,663
Bring her about.

529
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,254
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

530
00:46:49,254 --> 00:46:51,673
Our laws allow the Captain
to show leniency.

531
00:46:51,673 --> 00:46:54,433
I have given this man
a chance to determine his fate,

532
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:56,264
a gift not afforded to all.

533
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,816
Oh, you now.

534
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,741
Chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

535
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:14,950
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

536
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,630
Course made.

537
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,631
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...

538
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,952
You know when I feel closest
to our Maker?

539
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,953
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

540
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:59,615
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

541
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:03,457
And I see it revealed when in times
of hardship and tragedy,

542
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:05,872
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

543
00:48:05,872 --> 00:48:08,416
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

544
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,755
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again.

545
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,063
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

546
00:48:26,063 --> 00:48:28,068
so, if your heart is set,

547
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:30,400
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

548
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,314
That will be all, Quartermaster.

549
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,829
Your words surround you like fog
and make you hard to see.

550
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:42,787
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

551
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,704
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

552
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:49,294
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

553
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:52,050
And here you are, running scared.

554
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,088
- Scared.
- To the Fountain.

555
00:48:56,088 --> 00:48:59,259
The Quartermaster
sees things before they happen.

556
00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:03,897
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

557
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:06,398
The threads of destiny woven.

558
00:49:06,398 --> 00:49:09,481
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

559
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:11,236
- And you?
- Me?

560
00:49:11,236 --> 00:49:15,650
I am skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

561
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:21,573
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

562
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:24,583
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

563
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:31,048
That knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

564
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:32,958
Mutiny served me well.

565
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:35,048
It gained me an audience with you.

566
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,259
Aye.

567
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,467
To warn you.

568
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,016
Regarding your first mate,

569
00:49:44,016 --> 00:49:47,057
who pretends to be persons she is not.

570
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,682
Do tell.

571
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,066
She is not your daughter.

572
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:59,405
You dare to speak
thusly of my flesh and blood?

573
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:04,074
Sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

574
00:50:04,074 --> 00:50:08,665
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

575
00:50:08,665 --> 00:50:10,750
Though I cannot claim credit

576
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,837
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

577
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:18,345
Angelica.
My beloved daughter,

578
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:21,098
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

579
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:23,884
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

580
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:28,056
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

581
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:30,600
More to be feared than a wild beast.

582
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,566
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

583
00:50:34,566 --> 00:50:36,731
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

584
00:50:36,731 --> 00:50:39,025
- Father?
- Sweetness.

585
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,532
No need to hurt him, Father.

586
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:45,914
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

587
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:49,794
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

588
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:53,502
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

589
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,560
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

590
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,058
Put another way.

591
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,266
If I do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

592
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,904
...neither will you.

593
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:23,194
I will have a wee look-see at those
charts straight away then, shall I?

594
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,199
Sir.

595
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,420
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

596
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,957
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

597
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:38,296
among the crew,
as to our destination.

598
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,469
Shut your trap and make way.

599
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,103
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.

600
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,727
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

601
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,812
Whitecap Bay.

602
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:58,070
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

603
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:02,279
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

604
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:04,785
though few know why or dare to ask.

605
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:06,570
Be the stories true?

606
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,535
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

607
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:11,826
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

608
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,129
Mermaids, Captain.

609
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:18,040
Aye. Mermaids.

610
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,336
Sea ghouls, devil fish,
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

611
00:52:22,336 --> 00:52:26,052
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

612
00:52:26,052 --> 00:52:27,762
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

613
00:52:27,762 --> 00:52:31,554
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

614
00:52:31,554 --> 00:52:33,097
...to the bone.

615
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,810
Steady. Steady, men.
Find your courage,

616
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,853
or be ready to purpose your fear.

617
00:52:39,853 --> 00:52:42,398
Save yourselves.

618
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,828
- Man overboard.
- Nay. A deserter.

619
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:49,738
- Come about.
- Nay.

620
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:54,831
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

621
00:52:54,831 --> 00:52:59,465
that man can deliver, but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

622
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:01,045
Aye.

623
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,962
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.

624
00:53:03,962 --> 00:53:08,348
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.

625
00:53:08,348 --> 00:53:11,226
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye.

626
00:53:11,226 --> 00:53:14,309
Aye. Hands all off, and bear away.

627
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:17,395
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay.

628
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,403
Bear on, Whitecap Bay.

629
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,877
Come.

630
00:53:36,877 --> 00:53:38,332
Little drink?

631
00:53:38,332 --> 00:53:41,715
Wine, music, candlelight.

632
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:44,092
I think we have traveled down
this road before, Jack.

633
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,049
Yes, we have.

634
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,422
I remember it well.

635
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:55,100
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

636
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,560
Incessant writhing.

637
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,566
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

638
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,569
La Martinique.

639
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:04,401
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

640
00:54:04,401 --> 00:54:06,315
Either or.

641
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,152
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

642
00:54:09,152 --> 00:54:12,742
Was I the first? I have often wondered.

643
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:17,125
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

644
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,753
The trick is finding out what.

645
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,965
The truth, then, is it?

646
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:26,176
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

647
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:28,632
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

648
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,844
where we shall bathe one another
in equal shares of fame

649
00:54:31,844 --> 00:54:34,010
and other assorted debaucheries.

650
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:37,146
And I will tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

651
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:40,103
Yes. The profane ritual.

652
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,024
Can I trust you, Jack?

653
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:49,568
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

654
00:54:49,568 --> 00:54:53,158
You and I are as
thick as thieves, love.

655
00:54:53,158 --> 00:54:55,539
Tell me the rules.

656
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:01,329
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

657
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,584
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

658
00:55:06,584 --> 00:55:10,050
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.

659
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,723
With these items...

660
00:55:13,723 --> 00:55:15,976
- Yes?
- With these items,

661
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:19,513
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

662
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,605
You know what that means.

663
00:55:23,605 --> 00:55:26,646
We cannot go alone, you and I.

664
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:29,065
The ritual requires a victim.

665
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:34,662
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

666
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,540
I find my desire for the Fountain
greatly lessened.

667
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:42,578
But there is something onboard
you do want.

668
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:49,718
What about Blackbeard?

669
00:55:49,718 --> 00:55:53,472
He's in the chart room.
We will have to be quick.

670
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,150
He keeps each ship as a prize.

671
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:11,361
You help me,
and I promise you your pick.

672
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:14,902
Though I think I know the one
you will choose.

673
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,293
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

674
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:25,169
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

675
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,804
He's even more annoying in miniature.

676
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:37,967
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

677
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:40,978
You are not going to steal the life
of some innocent man.

678
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,851
What about the one-legged man?

679
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,726
I need years, Jack.

680
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,986
Not for me. For my father.

681
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,907
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

682
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,118
You have fallen for your own con, love.

683
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,534
No, he is my father.

684
00:57:03,534 --> 00:57:05,373
The lies I told you were not lies.

685
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,048
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

686
00:57:10,048 --> 00:57:12,209
- Yes.
- That's very good.

687
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:14,799
- May I use that?
- I am sure you will, anyway.

688
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,305
Of course I will.

689
00:57:17,305 --> 00:57:20,138
So, will you not give up this quest?

690
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,888
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

691
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,392
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

692
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,319
...he is evil,

693
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:33,651
and he will kill you given the chance.

694
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:36,908
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

695
00:57:36,908 --> 00:57:39,240
the limits on redemption?

696
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,702
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.

697
00:57:42,702 --> 00:57:45,913
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

698
00:57:45,913 --> 00:57:48,374
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

699
00:57:48,374 --> 00:57:52,257
Whitecap Bay.

700
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:00,758
All hands on deck.
Set to the longboats.

701
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,845
Lay them out flat.

702
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:11,310
No tangles. Make them look
pretty for our dainty guests.

703
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:15,276
We're going to need light.
A lot of light.

704
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,066
Come.

705
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:45,102
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

706
00:58:45,102 --> 00:58:48,981
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.

707
00:58:48,981 --> 00:58:50,231
Let's not get our hopes up.

708
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,199
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

709
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:04,579
First of the summer.

710
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,708
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

711
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:24,884
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.

712
00:59:24,884 --> 00:59:27,724
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

713
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:30,389
There will be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

714
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:34,025
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

715
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,318
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

716
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,330
Don't be a fool.
Mermaids are all female, son,

717
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,242
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

718
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:53,662
But when it comes time
to churn butter, so to speak,

719
00:59:53,662 --> 00:59:55,796
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

720
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:58,959
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

721
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:04,052
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

722
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,931
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

723
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,851
- Sing.
- What?

724
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,351
They like to hear singing.

725
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:23,279
My name is Maria

726
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:26,570
A merchant's daughter fair

727
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:30,332
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents

728
01:00:30,332 --> 01:00:33,665
And 3,000 pounds a year

729
01:00:33,665 --> 01:00:36,831
My heart is pierced by Cupid

730
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:40,421
I disdain all glittering gold

731
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:44,053
There is nothing can console me

732
01:00:44,053 --> 01:00:47,091
But my jolly sailor bold

733
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,813
My heart is pierced by Cupid

734
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:56,646
I disdain all glittering gold

735
01:00:56,646 --> 01:00:59,527
There is nothing can console me

736
01:00:59,527 --> 01:01:04,158
But my jolly sailor bold

737
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,585
Lord save me.

738
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,308
Man, look. Look there.

739
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,268
You will scare her off.

740
01:01:32,268 --> 01:01:33,929
Aye, and good riddance.

741
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,602
Can you talk?

742
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,814
Yes.

743
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,831
You're beautiful.

744
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,412
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

745
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,755
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

746
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,217
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself.

747
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,557
Boys. There ain't much been given to me

748
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:14,094
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

749
01:02:14,094 --> 01:02:15,978
But, by God, I will have it said

750
01:02:15,978 --> 01:02:19,516
that Scrum had himself a kiss
from a proper mermaid.

751
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,404
My heart is pierced by Cupid

752
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,067
I disdain all glittering gold

753
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:31,612
There is nothing can console me

754
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:35,874
But my jolly sailor bold

755
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:40,871
Come all ye pretty fair maids

756
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:45,254
Whoever you may be

757
01:02:45,254 --> 01:02:48,966
Who love a jolly sailor bold

758
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:53,850
That ploughs the raging sea

759
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:58,104
My heart is pierced by Cupid

760
01:02:58,104 --> 01:03:02,439
I disdain all glittering gold

761
01:03:02,439 --> 01:03:06,776
There is nothing can console me

762
01:03:06,776 --> 01:03:11,284
But my jolly sailor bold

763
01:03:11,284 --> 01:03:16,574
My heart is pierced by Cupid

764
01:03:16,574 --> 01:03:19,959
I disdain all glittering gold

765
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:24,169
There is nothing can console me

766
01:03:24,169 --> 01:03:28,130
But my jolly sailor bold

767
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:07,291
Out upon it. It has begun.

768
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,042
Light them up.

769
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:55,760
Muster your courage.
Drive them to shore.

770
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:09,649
Nets into the water. Quickly.

771
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,538
Retreat, all, to land.
For your lives.

772
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,285
Retreat, I say.

773
01:06:07,285 --> 01:06:09,455
Cowards. Back in the water.

774
01:06:09,455 --> 01:06:13,796
There be no refuge on land.
On my word.

775
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,456
Come on.

776
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,218
We got one.

777
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,853
I am in love.

778
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,020
Check the wounded.

779
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,936
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive.

780
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,393
Come, give a hand.

781
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,647
Well done, sailor.

782
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,274
Did everyone see that?

783
01:09:24,274 --> 01:09:26,443
Because I will not be doing it again.

784
01:09:26,443 --> 01:09:31,285
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.

785
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:51,054
- Lord. Is that...?
- Mermaid.

786
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:54,721
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

787
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,639
Ever walk on the beach,

788
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:59,059
Look back and see your footsteps
in the sand?

789
01:09:59,059 --> 01:10:03,196
It's like that,
except the footsteps lie before me.

790
01:10:03,196 --> 01:10:07,154
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.

791
01:10:07,154 --> 01:10:08,909
We must hasten.

792
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:20,580
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.

793
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,875
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

794
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:27,136
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

795
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:31,595
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

796
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:33,805
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

797
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:40,270
Seagulls... nesting.

798
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,482
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

799
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,701
My God.

800
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:55,866
Your head or my heading.

801
01:10:55,866 --> 01:10:58,904
I will have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

802
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,667
All hands, forward.

803
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:25,612
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

804
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:28,398
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

805
01:11:28,398 --> 01:11:33,240
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.

806
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,120
What I want first...

807
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,747
...is Ponce De Leon's ship.

808
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,661
Why is it we have got to bring her along?

809
01:12:19,661 --> 01:12:23,044
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

810
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:25,921
What is the ritual again?

811
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,504
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

812
01:12:28,504 --> 01:12:30,168
And two silver chalices.

813
01:12:30,168 --> 01:12:32,962
One cup with a tear, one without.

814
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,633
So, one with a tear and water in both?

815
01:12:36,633 --> 01:12:38,301
Quite complicated, is it not?

816
01:12:38,301 --> 01:12:41,516
Both get water. One gets a tear.

817
01:12:41,516 --> 01:12:44,307
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

818
01:12:44,307 --> 01:12:46,942
gets all the years of life
from the other.

819
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,191
How many years?

820
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,617
All the years
that they have lived,

821
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:58,279
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

822
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:08,873
Clergyman.

823
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,799
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

824
01:13:13,799 --> 01:13:15,509
I would like it noted here and now

825
01:13:15,509 --> 01:13:18,891
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

826
01:13:18,891 --> 01:13:20,801
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

827
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:23,346
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

828
01:13:23,346 --> 01:13:27,142
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

829
01:13:27,142 --> 01:13:29,777
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

830
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,024
Quartermaster.

831
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,367
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe.

832
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:40,575
- She has water.
- She needs air.

833
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,456
- Open this.
- She will escape.

834
01:13:46,456 --> 01:13:50,340
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

835
01:13:58,893 --> 01:13:59,928
See?

836
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,685
Onward.

837
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,338
Just as I thought. Not this way.

838
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,840
This is the way, isn't it?

839
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,802
Of course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

840
01:14:40,802 --> 01:14:42,808
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

841
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:44,719
- Well, then we will circle back.
- There is no time.

842
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,512
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

843
01:14:46,512 --> 01:14:48,647
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

844
01:14:48,647 --> 01:14:50,900
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

845
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,478
You mean split up?

846
01:14:53,478 --> 01:14:56,523
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

847
01:14:56,523 --> 01:15:00,614
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

848
01:15:00,614 --> 01:15:02,779
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

849
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:06,165
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

850
01:15:06,165 --> 01:15:08,792
We cannot trust him, Father.
I will go.

851
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,378
She will go.

852
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:16,759
How much farther to the Fountain?

853
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:18,590
I am running out of time.

854
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,715
About a day's march north,
following that river,

855
01:15:22,715 --> 01:15:26,351
you will get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.

856
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,098
You will go.

857
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,315
I was sure it would come to this.

858
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:53,037
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

859
01:15:53,037 --> 01:15:55,126
Sudden urge to jump?

860
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,589
I don't have it.

861
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,504
I need those chalices.

862
01:16:01,504 --> 01:16:04,139
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

863
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:07,347
You will go. You will return...

864
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,645
...or I will kill her.

865
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,976
You won't kill your own daughter.

866
01:16:14,976 --> 01:16:17,896
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

867
01:16:17,896 --> 01:16:19,655
remove the shot from all but two,

868
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:22,282
but do not tell me which two.

869
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,162
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

870
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,120
No.

871
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,369
No.

872
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:40,297
- Yes.
- You're sure?

873
01:16:40,297 --> 01:16:41,881
Of course I am.

874
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,182
Again.

875
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:55,224
Please, they're not even loaded.

876
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,447
Again.

877
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,191
If you're so keen on killing her,

878
01:17:04,191 --> 01:17:06,736
why don't you just let her jump?
What?

879
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,997
If you jump and die,

880
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:13,785
then she will have her chance.

881
01:17:13,785 --> 01:17:15,419
Again.

882
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,541
Oi...

883
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:24,553
...if I jump, will I survive?

884
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,223
The doll.

885
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:49,287
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense. I am going.

886
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:11,266
Wet. Wet again.

887
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,473
We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

888
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:18,649
Well played, Father.

889
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,732
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

890
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,448
Of course, my love.

891
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,836
Be nice to have a map about now.

892
01:18:39,836 --> 01:18:41,622
Or a ship.

893
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:46,093
Stop. Hold very still.

894
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:51,048
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

895
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:03,026
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

896
01:19:03,026 --> 01:19:05,688
What are you stopping for, eh?
Push on.

897
01:19:05,688 --> 01:19:08,027
- Push on.
- You can sleep when you're dead.

898
01:19:08,027 --> 01:19:09,362
Push on.

899
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:14,329
Fortune continues to favor us.

900
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,318
The Santiago.

901
01:19:44,318 --> 01:19:47,195
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon.

902
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,404
There's no one there.

903
01:19:51,404 --> 01:19:52,567
Right, then.

904
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,646
We must not stop.

905
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,447
You will walk.

906
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,760
I cannot.

907
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,678
Walk or die.

908
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:09,361
Put your arms around me.

909
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:12,898
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

910
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:34,132
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

911
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,198
Hold here till I say.

912
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,129
Such beauty.

913
01:22:10,129 --> 01:22:13,588
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

914
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:16,674
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

915
01:22:16,674 --> 01:22:19,090
who found no refuge on the Ark.

916
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,011
Such beauty...

917
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,896
...and yet deadly.

918
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:31,359
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

919
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:36,445
No. You are different.

920
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,571
Different?

921
01:22:38,571 --> 01:22:42,738
Are you not? You protect.

922
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,205
Did you...?

923
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,623
You pushed me down out of the way.

924
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:57,261
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

925
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,679
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

926
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,806
She has a name.

927
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:07,846
Pray tell.

928
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,945
She is Syrena.

929
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,439
Ponce de Leon.

930
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:05,825
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

931
01:24:05,825 --> 01:24:09,537
it would not match
the contents of this room.

932
01:24:09,537 --> 01:24:11,247
You.

933
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,835
- You.
- No...

934
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,251
...you. I was here first.

935
01:24:19,251 --> 01:24:23,422
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

936
01:24:23,422 --> 01:24:26,057
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices....

937
01:24:26,057 --> 01:24:29,561
....for my royal liege. Oh, please.

938
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,597
Back, back. We have to balance it out.

939
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:37,193
The whole ship will slide.

940
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,574
Right, then.

941
01:24:42,574 --> 01:24:48,660
What if we each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

942
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,746
Put it back.

943
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:56,334
We touch nothing.

944
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,221
What about that?

945
01:25:05,221 --> 01:25:07,724
The chalices.

946
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,969
Oi. Why do you get to look first?

947
01:25:10,969 --> 01:25:12,809
Fine, then.

948
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:33,621
- Together.
- Together.

949
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,370
Rocks.

950
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,798
The Spanish.

951
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,213
They're ahead of us, mate.

952
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,380
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...

953
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,692
I wonder why they left this behind.

954
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:05,441
Don't touch the map.

955
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:11,912
They know the path,

956
01:26:11,912 --> 01:26:15,952
but I can also see where
they will most likely make camp.

957
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,719
Jack.

958
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:38,057
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.

959
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,518
You stole my map.

960
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:44,526
Right. Best be started.

961
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,109
Ole.

962
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:08,003
Mermaids.

963
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,763
Careful, these pools run deep.

964
01:27:13,763 --> 01:27:17,475
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

965
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:22,393
Look. Look.

966
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,942
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

967
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:30,701
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

968
01:27:30,701 --> 01:27:35,035
but just enough to make the dying slow.

969
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,240
Think on it.

970
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,786
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

971
01:27:40,786 --> 01:27:45,253
Syrena, won't you cry?

972
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,964
All die, even you.

973
01:27:47,964 --> 01:27:51,551
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

974
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,474
Listen.

975
01:27:55,474 --> 01:27:58,933
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

976
01:27:58,933 --> 01:28:01,519
Do you not hear them?

977
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:05,356
We need but one tear.

978
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,526
Vile creature.

979
01:28:09,526 --> 01:28:12,238
- Chop off her fingers, one by one.
- Choke her.

980
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:14,994
Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes.

981
01:28:14,994 --> 01:28:16,450
Where's your voice in this?

982
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,367
Maybe she will have a change of heart
when the sun rises.

983
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:24,413
Oh, aye, she will burn,
but I cannot wait for the sun.

984
01:28:24,413 --> 01:28:26,252
Perhaps we should build a fire.

985
01:28:26,252 --> 01:28:28,542
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

986
01:28:28,542 --> 01:28:31,757
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

987
01:28:31,757 --> 01:28:35,049
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one if I see fit.

988
01:28:35,049 --> 01:28:36,763
If that displeases you, go pray.

989
01:28:36,763 --> 01:28:40,020
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

990
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,023
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

991
01:28:43,023 --> 01:28:46,060
That vile creature, as you call her,
is worth a hundred of you.

992
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:47,944
Oh, you care for her?

993
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,982
You fancy her.

994
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,410
And do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

995
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,330
Question is...

996
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,502
...does she fancy you?

997
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,338
By God, she does. We are in luck.

998
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:13,636
Bring forth a tear...

999
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,674
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

1000
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:23,268
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

1001
01:29:23,268 --> 01:29:24,977
I would be grateful.

1002
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,942
Sadness, yes,

1003
01:29:27,942 --> 01:29:33,483
but no sorrow... yet.
Not by your hand, Father.

1004
01:29:33,483 --> 01:29:36,276
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

1005
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:52,091
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1006
01:29:52,091 --> 01:29:54,253
The lot of them.

1007
01:29:54,253 --> 01:29:58,800
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

1008
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,356
- You are confident?
- Yes.

1009
01:30:06,356 --> 01:30:09,484
I am a woman. So is she.

1010
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:20,529
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

1011
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,365
There is a girl...

1012
01:30:23,365 --> 01:30:26,706
...a female... of the opposite sex.

1013
01:30:26,706 --> 01:30:30,793
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

1014
01:30:30,793 --> 01:30:33,959
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

1015
01:30:33,959 --> 01:30:37,345
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel....

1016
01:30:37,345 --> 01:30:41,053
...some manner of harm many moons ago.
Out with it.

1017
01:30:41,053 --> 01:30:44,515
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

1018
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:48,557
Ah, you pretended to love her,
then you left her and broke her heart.

1019
01:30:48,557 --> 01:30:53,399
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

1020
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:58,734
...stirrings. Stirrings?

1021
01:30:58,734 --> 01:31:02,871
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?

1022
01:31:02,871 --> 01:31:06,033
No, no, no. Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

1023
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,754
All right, feelings, damn you.

1024
01:31:11,754 --> 01:31:16,589
And you left her still.
That's low.

1025
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:19,262
Thank you.

1026
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,599
Stealth over force.

1027
01:31:27,599 --> 01:31:31,483
I will take it from here
on account of your condition.

1028
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:34,485
You don't have termites, do you?

1029
01:31:34,485 --> 01:31:36,612
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1030
01:31:36,612 --> 01:31:39,274
but I will be keeping
you company all the same.

1031
01:31:39,274 --> 01:31:42,489
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander.
Wait for my signal.

1032
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:16,569
There. That one.
That be the leader.

1033
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:19,197
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

1034
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:24,911
No, wait. By God,
that must be them right there.

1035
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,667
Your sword smells funny.

1036
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:35,706
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

1037
01:32:35,706 --> 01:32:38,967
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

1038
01:32:38,967 --> 01:32:41,423
Would you mind pointing it
the other way?

1039
01:32:41,423 --> 01:32:43,338
I don't like toads.

1040
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:51,642
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

1041
01:32:51,642 --> 01:32:55,855
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

1042
01:32:55,855 --> 01:32:59,112
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

1043
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:27,598
Now what?

1044
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,011
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1045
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:32,975
Just like we belong.

1046
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:36,667
- I am sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

1047
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:41,002
- Yes.
- You came for me.

1048
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,376
Why?

1049
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:48,800
You're different, are you not?

1050
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:55,353
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

1051
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:14,538
Tears of sorrow, never.

1052
01:35:14,538 --> 01:35:17,121
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1053
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:19,411
But tears of joy...

1054
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:23,331
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

1055
01:35:23,331 --> 01:35:26,467
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

1056
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,174
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

1057
01:35:29,174 --> 01:35:32,261
Let her go? No.

1058
01:35:32,261 --> 01:35:35,393
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

1059
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,945
How's that escape route working?

1060
01:35:46,945 --> 01:35:50,028
Here's your chance to improvise.

1061
01:35:50,028 --> 01:35:51,488
I am attempting it.

1062
01:35:51,488 --> 01:35:54,450
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1063
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:56,865
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

1064
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,492
Better.

1065
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:06,208
I want one of those.

1066
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:15,141
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1067
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:19,725
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.

1068
01:36:19,725 --> 01:36:21,264
If you wanted the chalices,

1069
01:36:21,264 --> 01:36:24,104
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1070
01:36:24,104 --> 01:36:27,396
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1071
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:32,617
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1072
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,198
Cheap theatrical facade.

1073
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:38,206
- I am not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

1074
01:36:38,206 --> 01:36:42,164
- When the Pearl was lost?
- Taken, not lost.

1075
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:48,917
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.

1076
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:52,508
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

1077
01:36:52,508 --> 01:36:55,298
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1078
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:59,685
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.

1079
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,640
The Pearl was pitching
and yawing violently.

1080
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,649
Every plank, every rail,

1081
01:37:05,649 --> 01:37:08,653
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

1082
01:37:08,653 --> 01:37:11,815
The rigging had come to life.

1083
01:37:11,815 --> 01:37:14,655
Our own ship turned against us...

1084
01:37:14,655 --> 01:37:18,071
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around them like snakes.

1085
01:37:18,071 --> 01:37:20,615
And wrapping around me leg.

1086
01:37:20,615 --> 01:37:23,159
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

1087
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:26,830
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

1088
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:30,466
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

1089
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,844
So I did what needed done.

1090
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,641
I survived.

1091
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:48,397
So... you're not after the Fountain.

1092
01:37:48,397 --> 01:37:52,189
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

1093
01:37:52,189 --> 01:37:54,574
that give hope for a healed limb.

1094
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:59,863
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

1095
01:37:59,863 --> 01:38:03,033
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

1096
01:38:03,033 --> 01:38:07,830
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

1097
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:11,253
I will see you get the chance, mate.

1098
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:31,332
The prisoner's escaping.

1099
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,301
He's escaping.
Fan out. Find him.

1100
01:39:41,301 --> 01:39:42,556
Go. Go.

1101
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:47,478
Hold your fire. I want him alive.

1102
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,651
I figured that was the signal.

1103
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:44,243
- Go. Prepare to move out.
- The enemy is soon upon us.

1104
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:48,910
I am sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I have an appointment to keep.

1105
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:52,043
- I will not be going back.
- No need.

1106
01:40:52,043 --> 01:40:55,205
- Shall we have a drink?
- We will drink at the Fountain.

1107
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:17,147
How is it we can never meet
without you pointing something at me?

1108
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:20,229
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1109
01:41:20,229 --> 01:41:22,789
- Aye. 
- Oi.

1110
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:29,580
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

1111
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:32,958
And the one-legged man, he is near.
Aye?

1112
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:34,494
Aye.

1113
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:36,328
Now...

1114
01:41:36,328 --> 01:41:39,294
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

1115
01:41:39,294 --> 01:41:41,504
- Name them.
- Firstly,

1116
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:44,011
I will be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.

1117
01:41:44,011 --> 01:41:46,388
Firstly, upon your word,

1118
01:41:46,388 --> 01:41:48,515
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1119
01:41:48,515 --> 01:41:51,018
I will make no vows
to the likes of you, Sparrow.

1120
01:41:51,018 --> 01:41:53,600
But it costs me nothing to admit

1121
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,607
that she was never in harm's way.

1122
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:59,439
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1123
01:41:59,439 --> 01:42:01,229
I will be having me compass back.

1124
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:04,149
Please? I do deserve it.

1125
01:42:04,149 --> 01:42:07,785
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

1126
01:42:07,785 --> 01:42:10,287
Not the big one,
the four-legged one.

1127
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:17,496
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1128
01:42:17,496 --> 01:42:20,335
there are times, not very often,

1129
01:42:20,335 --> 01:42:23,592
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

1130
01:42:23,592 --> 01:42:28,006
Chief among them, I note how poorly
I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1131
01:42:28,006 --> 01:42:30,800
my loyal first mate.
Aye. Now you bring it up...

1132
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,640
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.

1133
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:38,433
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

1134
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:43,654
- Is that it?
- I think so.

1135
01:42:43,654 --> 01:42:46,406
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting those chalices.

1136
01:42:46,406 --> 01:42:47,987
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...

1137
01:42:47,987 --> 01:42:49,447
Done.

1138
01:42:49,447 --> 01:42:50,782
Release the swine.

1139
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:59,837
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1140
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,842
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1141
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,393
I could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.

1142
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,860
We must not stop.

1143
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:05,580
Dead end.

1144
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,545
Dead. End.

1145
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:10,626
Dead end.

1146
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:14,634
Jack, I am starting to think
you don't know where you're going.

1147
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:18,263
It is not the destination
so much as the journey, they say.

1148
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:20,932
Chalices, if you please.

1149
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,483
Stand back.

1150
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:58,428
Jack...

1151
01:45:58,428 --> 01:46:00,433
...have you ever, in fact...

1152
01:46:00,433 --> 01:46:06,144
...seen with your own eyes...
the Fountain of Youth?

1153
01:46:06,144 --> 01:46:08,479
I am sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?

1154
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:10,110
Quartermaster.

1155
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:11,983
No, no.

1156
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,819
Wait, wait. Wait.

1157
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:25,539
"Aqua... de Vida."

1158
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:07,410
Master Scrum...

1159
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:10,421
...do you mind? Squire?

1160
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:11,105
So beautiful.

1161
01:48:50,249 --> 01:48:53,931
Sparrow, I will be the first
to taste those waters.

1162
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,321
Father.

1163
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:04,860
The one-legged man.

1164
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,371
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

1165
01:49:11,371 --> 01:49:13,627
Edward Teach.

1166
01:49:13,627 --> 01:49:17,039
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1167
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:21,051
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...

1168
01:49:21,051 --> 01:49:24,384
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

1169
01:49:24,384 --> 01:49:27,595
...I hereby place you
in the custody of the court,

1170
01:49:27,595 --> 01:49:31,058
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1171
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:35,641
My trick's out, is that it?

1172
01:49:35,641 --> 01:49:40,188
Such crimes do include, but are not
limited to, piracy, treason,

1173
01:49:40,188 --> 01:49:44,483
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

1174
01:49:44,483 --> 01:49:48,529
including the brutal theft of one used,
twisted, hairy right leg.

1175
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:54,038
You... dare face this sword?

1176
01:49:54,038 --> 01:49:56,625
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1177
01:49:56,625 --> 01:50:01,509
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.

1178
01:50:01,509 --> 01:50:07,298
But I will have one last fight, by God.

1179
01:50:07,298 --> 01:50:09,182
Kill them all.

1180
01:50:10,854 --> 01:50:12,594
Hang on a minute.

1181
01:50:12,594 --> 01:50:16,641
I just... I just need
to understand something.

1182
01:50:16,641 --> 01:50:20,152
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1183
01:50:20,152 --> 01:50:21,607
they will fight against you.

1184
01:50:21,607 --> 01:50:25,445
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?

1185
01:50:25,445 --> 01:50:29,532
Where is the sense? Exactly.

1186
01:50:29,532 --> 01:50:33,415
I say, let them fight
each other while we lay back,

1187
01:50:33,415 --> 01:50:36,998
watch, have a drink,
place some wagers.

1188
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,417
Aye.

1189
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,291
- Kill them.
- No quarter.

1190
01:51:14,126 --> 01:51:15,741
Get off me.

1191
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:49,733
Scrum, the chalices.

1192
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:52,994
And the tear. Follow.

1193
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:58,204
Fight.

1194
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:02,663
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

1195
01:52:02,663 --> 01:52:05,127
I am more afraid of her
than I am of you.

1196
01:52:10,682 --> 01:52:13,048
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.

1197
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,189
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

1198
01:52:20,189 --> 01:52:24,568
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.

1199
01:52:32,537 --> 01:52:33,697
Scrum.

1200
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:56,850
Syrena...

1201
01:53:00,565 --> 01:53:03,352
Oh God, you will not take her.

1202
01:53:03,352 --> 01:53:08,442
If you have taken her,
you will give her back.

1203
01:53:08,442 --> 01:53:10,947
Give her back...

1204
01:53:10,947 --> 01:53:13,951
Give her back, please. Please.

1205
01:53:37,602 --> 01:53:40,309
I expected fate
to put up more of a fight, eh?

1206
01:53:57,205 --> 01:54:00,914
I will not have that smile
on your face as I strike you down.

1207
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:05,456
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1208
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:39,324
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

1209
01:54:39,324 --> 01:54:42,035
of His Majesty King George...

1210
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:51,207
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

1211
01:54:58,225 --> 01:55:01,934
Senorita, the chalices, por favor.

1212
01:55:18,662 --> 01:55:24,282
Only God can grant eternal life,
not this pagan water.

1213
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:38,845
Men, destroy this profane temple.

1214
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:42,886
The Fountain.

1215
01:55:56,992 --> 01:55:58,482
You are a fool.

1216
01:55:58,482 --> 01:56:01,902
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

1217
01:56:01,902 --> 01:56:04,571
Faith? In faith,
there is light enough to see

1218
01:56:04,571 --> 01:56:06,956
but darkness enough to blind.

1219
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:12,830
What devilry is this?

1220
01:56:16,845 --> 01:56:19,427
- For the Pearl..
- What have you done?

1221
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,342
Angelica. Don't. It's poison.

1222
01:56:30,025 --> 01:56:32,311
I am not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard

1223
01:56:32,311 --> 01:56:35,853
without a little venomous advantage.

1224
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:38,655
Jack.

1225
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:52,540
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1226
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:56,127
and this sword,
payment for my missing limb.

1227
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:11,930
Hang on. Pull.

1228
01:57:57,237 --> 01:57:59,569
Do not waste my tear.

1229
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,176
Drink this.
This one has the tear.

1230
01:58:31,176 --> 01:58:33,310
- You must drink the other.
- No.

1231
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:37,315
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

1232
01:58:38,278 --> 01:58:41,361
You take it, Father, for your soul.

1233
01:58:43,408 --> 01:58:48,823
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

1234
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,782
This one takes life?

1235
01:58:52,782 --> 01:58:54,790
This one has the tear and gives life?

1236
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:56,201
Aye, hurry.

1237
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:09,381
Angelica...
Save me, my child.

1238
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:12,061
No.

1239
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:22,856
I love you, Father.

1240
01:59:35,877 --> 01:59:37,458
Wait a minute.

1241
01:59:39,673 --> 01:59:42,460
In fact, it might have been
the other way around.

1242
01:59:43,343 --> 01:59:47,131
This cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.

1243
01:59:47,131 --> 01:59:48,511
Trickster.

1244
01:59:48,511 --> 01:59:50,513
- Devil.
- Father.

1245
01:59:57,565 --> 01:59:59,055
You bastard. How could you?

1246
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:01,520
Your father saved you.

1247
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:04,186
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1248
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,131
You are hurt.

1249
02:01:09,387 --> 02:01:11,252
In body only.

1250
02:01:12,974 --> 02:01:17,183
My mind is at peace...
because of you.

1251
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:21,104
- Me?
- Yes.

1252
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:24,516
I was lost.

1253
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:30,147
The wind, the tides...

1254
02:01:30,147 --> 02:01:33,362
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1255
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:36,865
But for me, only you.

1256
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:41,500
Philip, I can save you.

1257
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:44,581
You need only ask.

1258
02:01:46,090 --> 02:01:50,834
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

1259
02:01:51,888 --> 02:01:54,220
Forgiveness.

1260
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:57,678
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.

1261
02:01:57,678 --> 02:01:59,467
Ask.

1262
02:02:01,397 --> 02:02:03,183
Forgive me?

1263
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:29,547
I hate you.

1264
02:02:29,547 --> 02:02:32,003
The bloke who saved your life?

1265
02:02:32,003 --> 02:02:35,341
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father.

1266
02:02:35,341 --> 02:02:38,507
I only helped Blackbeard do what
any father should have done.

1267
02:02:38,507 --> 02:02:41,848
You are cruel and ignorant.

1268
02:02:45,608 --> 02:02:49,351
One pistol, one shot.

1269
02:02:49,351 --> 02:02:51,736
To kill myself before I starve?

1270
02:02:51,736 --> 02:02:53,442
There's no trusting you, love.

1271
02:02:53,442 --> 02:02:56,028
Besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.

1272
02:02:56,028 --> 02:02:57,783
You can signal a passing ship.

1273
02:02:57,783 --> 02:03:01,367
Or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.

1274
02:03:01,367 --> 02:03:03,122
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

1275
02:03:03,122 --> 02:03:06,000
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

1276
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,957
waiting for the precise moment
to pounce.

1277
02:03:11,676 --> 02:03:13,337
Admit it, Jack.

1278
02:03:13,337 --> 02:03:17,379
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

1279
02:03:17,379 --> 02:03:19,843
I'd choose the dog.

1280
02:03:19,843 --> 02:03:23,351
Treasure.
There is a chest with jewels.

1281
02:03:23,351 --> 02:03:25,728
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide.

1282
02:03:25,728 --> 02:03:28,982
- You're making that up.
- Wait...

1283
02:03:29,819 --> 02:03:33,482
I am with child. Yours.

1284
02:03:34,741 --> 02:03:36,106
I don't recall that we ever had...

1285
02:03:36,106 --> 02:03:38,991
You were drunk.
I have actually never been that drunk.

1286
02:03:38,991 --> 02:03:40,242
Wait.

1287
02:03:42,165 --> 02:03:44,201
There is something I want to say to you.

1288
02:03:44,201 --> 02:03:48,539
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

1289
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:50,585
Go on, then.

1290
02:03:52,967 --> 02:03:54,252
I love you.

1291
02:03:57,889 --> 02:03:59,675
As do I.

1292
02:03:59,675 --> 02:04:03,262
Always have. Always will.

1293
02:04:07,815 --> 02:04:09,271
I got to go.

1294
02:04:09,271 --> 02:04:10,431
Jack.

1295
02:04:12,779 --> 02:04:14,360
This is not over.

1296
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:16,483
Jack.

1297
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:27,574
Missed.

1298
02:04:42,892 --> 02:04:45,884
The Revenge is mine.

1299
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:54,020
Sir...

1300
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:58,362
We found this below decks.

1301
02:05:24,475 --> 02:05:26,716
All hands.
Ply to windward.

1302
02:05:26,716 --> 02:05:30,432
Get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches.

1303
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:35,733
The Crown served me well.

1304
02:05:35,733 --> 02:05:38,861
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1305
02:05:38,861 --> 02:05:43,116
...make way for Tortuga.

1306
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:57,372
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
you made it.

1307
02:05:57,372 --> 02:05:59,086
Aye.

1308
02:05:59,086 --> 02:06:00,750
And I trust we managed a profit

1309
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:05,137
from our joint enterprise?
Feast your eyes.

1310
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:12,720
The compass led me straight and true.

1311
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:14,855
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

1312
02:06:14,855 --> 02:06:18,860
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.

1313
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:23,069
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

1314
02:06:23,069 --> 02:06:25,278
Shame indeed.

1315
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:38,587
I hate that monkey.

1316
02:06:38,587 --> 02:06:42,171
So, the Pearl....
Any idea how to get her out?

1317
02:06:42,171 --> 02:06:45,337
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

1318
02:06:45,337 --> 02:06:48,507
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

1319
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:52,302
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.

1320
02:06:54,982 --> 02:06:56,597
Jack, I have to ask...

1321
02:06:56,597 --> 02:06:59,609
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

1322
02:06:59,609 --> 02:07:02,270
You could have lived maybe forever.

1323
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:04,404
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1324
02:07:04,404 --> 02:07:07,442
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

1325
02:07:07,442 --> 02:07:09,611
Every morsel of your entire being

1326
02:07:09,611 --> 02:07:12,872
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1327
02:07:12,872 --> 02:07:15,533
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

1328
02:07:15,533 --> 02:07:18,794
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

1329
02:07:18,794 --> 02:07:21,832
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1330
02:07:21,832 --> 02:07:23,965
It's a pirate's life for me.

1331
02:07:24,929 --> 02:07:26,419
Savvy?
