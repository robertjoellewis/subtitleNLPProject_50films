1
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:26,671
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,019
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,524
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:52,030
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:55,491
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:59,662
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:04,667
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:28,066
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:32,153
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:36,824
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,078
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,997
There you go.

13
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,924
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:58,429
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,600
- They really are--
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:07,814
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:09,774
Exactly.

18
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,278
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,450
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:36,968
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,481
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:53,484
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,130
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,176
Now!

25
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,276
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:51,709
- Here comes the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,714
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:01,928
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,056
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:10,228
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,565
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:20,238
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,699
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:27,745
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

35
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,498
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:35,086
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:42,385
It should be a lovely day
at the zoo. I'm looking forward to it.

38
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,765
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,519
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,772
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,275
Get in.

42
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,868
Make it move.

43
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,247
Move!

44
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,958
- Move!
- He's asleep!

45
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,711
He's boring.

46
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,635
Sorry about him. He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

47
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,890
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

48
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,312
Can you hear me?

49
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:40,818
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

50
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,737
Do you...?

51
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:47,074
Do you talk to people often?

52
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,495
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

53
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,998
Do you miss your family?

54
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:01,589
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

55
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:06,802
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

56
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,869
Thanks.

57
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,537
Anytime.

58
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,793
Snake!

59
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:57,603
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

60
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,982
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

61
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:06,570
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

62
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:16,747
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

63
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,419
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

64
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:25,506
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

65
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,722
There's no such thing as magic.

66
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,280
And smile.

67
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,492
Vernon, just look at him.
I can't believe it.

68
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,203
In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

69
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,374
Caveat to Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

70
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,252
Will I have to wear that too?

71
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,673
- What? You, go to Smeltings?
- Ha!

72
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:16,015
Don't be so stupid. You're going to go
to the state school, where you belong.

73
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:19,727
This is what you're going to be wearing
when I finish dyeing it.

74
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:23,939
But that's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

75
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,692
It'll fit you well enough.

76
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,237
Go get the post. Go!

77
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,103
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

78
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,524
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

79
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,485
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

80
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:45,271
No more mail through this letterbox.

81
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,286
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

82
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,875
Shoo! Go on.

83
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,685
Fine day, Sunday.

84
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:11,982
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

85
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:16,570
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

86
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,573
No post on Sunday.

87
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:24,912
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

88
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:30,417
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

89
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,763
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

90
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,443
Make it stop, please!

91
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,197
Stop it!

92
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:07,287
Mummy, what's happening?

93
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:15,045
Give me that! Give me that letter!

94
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,425
Get off!

95
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:27,349
They're my letters! Let go of me!

96
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,145
That's it! We're going away!

97
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:35,482
Far away, where they can't find us!

98
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,986
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

99
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,190
Make a wish, Harry.

100
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,333
Who's there?

101
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,931
Sorry about that.

102
00:14:55,813 --> 00:15:00,400
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

103
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,073
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

104
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,832
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

105
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,586
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

106
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,589
I'm not Harry.

107
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:28,178
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

108
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,556
Got something for you.

109
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:36,353
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

110
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,276
Baked it myself, words and all.

111
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,866
Thank you.

112
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:53,245
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

113
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,556
Excuse me, but who are you?

114
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:17,644
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

115
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,648
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

116
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:27,154
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

117
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,780
Learned what?

118
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,533
You're a wizard, Harry.

119
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,786
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

120
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,040
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

121
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,168
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

122
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,338
...I can't be a wizard.

123
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:49,801
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

124
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:54,848
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

125
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:59,770
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

126
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,023
Hm.

127
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,289
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

128
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,709
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

129
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,881
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

130
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:32,344
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

131
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,639
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

132
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,559
My perfect sister being who she was.

133
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:45,732
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

134
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:50,112
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

135
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,991
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

136
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,909
A freak!

137
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,121
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

138
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:05,043
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

139
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:10,257
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

140
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:14,428
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

141
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,016
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

142
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:23,145
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

143
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,772
He'll not be going.

144
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,359
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

145
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,569
Muggle?

146
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,906
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

147
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,952
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

148
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:45,125
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

149
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:50,130
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

150
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:54,885
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

151
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,137
...in front of me.

152
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:20,285
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

153
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:24,623
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

154
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,919
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

155
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,303
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

156
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,404
"First-year students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

157
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,448
...one wand."

158
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,617
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

159
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,663
"One pair of dragon-hide gloves."

160
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,790
Hagrid, do they mean from a real dragon?

161
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:10,252
Well, they don't mean a penguin, do they?
Ha.

162
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:15,382
- Crikey, I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

163
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,135
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.

164
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,971
Vastly misunderstood.

165
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,522
"All students must be equipped with...

166
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,692
...one standard size 2 pewter cauldron...

167
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,698
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

168
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,534
Can we find all this in London?

169
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,120
If you know where to go.

170
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,854
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

171
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,941
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

172
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,236
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

173
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,032
Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!

174
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,748
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

175
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:34,336
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

176
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:40,050
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

177
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,761
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

178
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:48,016
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

179
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,602
Oh, nice to meet you.

180
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,980
Fearfully fascinating subject.

181
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,777
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

182
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,907
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

183
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,867
Goodbye.

184
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:12,123
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

185
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,794
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

186
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:19,798
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

187
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:40,610
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

188
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,462
Here, you get your quills and ink.

189
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,633
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

190
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,702
It's a world-class racing broom.

191
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:34,831
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

192
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,376
It's the fastest model yet.

193
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,676
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

194
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:50,221
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

195
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:55,977
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

196
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,619
Hagrid, what exactly are these things?

197
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:18,083
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

198
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,251
Best stay close.

199
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:27,926
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

200
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,350
And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?

201
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,521
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

202
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,193
Ha! There's the little devil.

203
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,279
And there's something else as well.

204
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,867
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

205
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:01,960
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

206
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,255
Very well.

207
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,304
Vault 687.

208
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,475
Lamp, please.

209
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,318
Key, please.

210
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,512
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

211
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:59,517
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

212
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,938
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

213
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,732
Stand back.

214
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,804
Best not to mention this to anyone.

215
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,150
I still need a wand.

216
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,779
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

217
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:58,576
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

218
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,429
Hello?

219
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,226
Hello?

220
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:31,025
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

221
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,035
It seems only yesterday...

222
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:47,125
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

223
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,092
Here we are.

224
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,228
Give it a wave.

225
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,237
Apparently not.

226
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,872
Perhaps...

227
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,667
...this.

228
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:41,387
No, no, definitely not. No matter.

229
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:50,188
I wonder...

230
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,719
Curious.

231
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,847
Very curious.

232
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:28,184
Sorry, but what's curious?

233
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:33,189
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

234
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,150
It so happens that the phoenix...

235
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,072
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

236
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:44,575
Just one other.

237
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:49,080
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

238
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:55,044
...when its brother gave you that scar.

239
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,091
And who owned that wand?

240
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,344
We do not speak his name.

241
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,265
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

242
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,518
It's not always clear why.

243
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,397
But I think it is clear...

244
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:18,526
...that we can expect
great things from you.

245
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:22,989
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

246
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,908
...did great things.

247
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,119
Terrible...

248
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:31,789
...yes, but great.

249
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,505
Harry! Harry!

250
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:42,258
Happy birthday.

251
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,802
Wow.

252
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,894
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

253
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:58,816
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

254
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:02,653
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

255
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:11,120
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

256
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,831
Not all wizards are good.

257
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,584
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

258
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:21,798
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

259
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:25,635
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

260
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,678
No, I can't spell it.

261
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:32,183
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

262
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,811
Shh.

263
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,356
It was dark times, Harry.

264
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,820
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

265
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,365
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

266
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,869
<i>Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.</i>

267
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:56,082
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

268
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,086
<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

269
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:07,051
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

270
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,637
<i>Except you.</i>

271
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:15,726
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

272
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:20,398
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

273
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:26,404
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

274
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:30,241
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

275
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:34,745
Well, some say he died.

276
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,415
Codswallop, in my opinion.

277
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,877
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

278
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:44,046
...too tired to carry on.

279
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:49,677
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

280
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:54,181
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

281
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,269
You're the boy who lived.

282
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,364
What are you looking at?

283
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:14,118
Blimey, is that the time?

284
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:18,289
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

285
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:23,419
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

286
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:28,966
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

287
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,096
"Platform 9 3/4"?

288
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:39,101
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

289
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,647
There's no such thing, is there?

290
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,750
Sorry.

291
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,004
Excuse me. Excuse me.

292
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,756
On your left.

293
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:12,802
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

294
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,513
Think you're being funny, do you?

295
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:19,100
It's the same
every year, packed with Muggles.

296
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,937
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

297
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,779
All right, Percy, you first.

298
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:42,957
Fred, you next.

299
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,877
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

300
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,046
I'm sorry, George.

301
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,553
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

302
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,978
Excuse me.

303
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,857
Could you tell me how to...?

304
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:11,569
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

305
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,280
It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.

306
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:20,411
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

307
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:24,081
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

308
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:25,935
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

309
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,354
Not at all.

310
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,859
I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

311
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,737
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

312
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:40,157
So it's true!

313
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,160
I mean, do you really have the...?

314
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:46,622
- The what?
- The scar?

315
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,166
Oh, yeah.

316
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,002
Wicked!

317
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:59,635
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

318
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,975
We'll take the lot.

319
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,020
Whoa.

320
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:21,490
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

321
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,286
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

322
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:29,331
...spinach, liver and tripe.

323
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,711
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

324
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:43,721
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

325
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:49,393
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

326
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,189
Watch it!

327
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:58,986
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

328
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:05,743
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

329
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:09,079
Hey, he's gone!

330
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,750
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

331
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,503
This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he?

332
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:17,880
A little.

333
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:21,425
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

334
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,677
Yeah.

335
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,061
Has anyone seen a toad?

336
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:35,105
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

337
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:40,027
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

338
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,407
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

339
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:48,744
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

340
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:57,127
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

341
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:00,589
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

342
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:03,425
...but they've all worked for me.

343
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,098
For example:

344
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:12,268
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

345
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,981
That's better, isn't it?

346
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:22,069
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

347
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:25,823
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

348
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,785
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

349
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:35,082
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

350
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,673
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

351
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,842
Just there.

352
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:00,983
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

353
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:06,363
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

354
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,373
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

355
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,624
Whoa.

356
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:21,795
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

357
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,034
Wow.

358
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,259
Wicked.

359
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,706
Welcome to Hogwarts.

360
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,919
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

361
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:49,174
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

362
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:52,469
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

363
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,182
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

364
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,646
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

365
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:06,775
Your triumphs will earn you points.

366
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:11,113
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

367
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:16,618
At the end of the year, the house with
the most points wins the house cup.

368
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:18,162
Trevor!

369
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,714
Sorry.

370
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:32,843
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

371
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,514
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

372
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,601
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

373
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,227
Harry Potter?

374
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:45,522
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

375
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,025
And I'm Malfoy.

376
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,694
Draco Malfoy.

377
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:56,241
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

378
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:02,247
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

379
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:07,211
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

380
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:11,215
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

381
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,550
I can help you there.

382
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:19,640
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

383
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,481
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

384
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:50,587
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

385
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:53,799
I read about it in <i>Hogwarts, A History.</i>

386
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,898
Will you wait along here, please?

387
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,111
Now, before we begin...

388
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,573
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

389
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:22,578
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

390
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:25,080
The first years, please note...

391
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:31,378
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

392
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:37,134
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

393
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:41,972
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

394
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:46,476
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

395
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,813
Thank you.

396
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:55,652
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

397
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:59,489
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

398
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:02,909
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

399
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:05,746
Hermione Granger.

400
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,626
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

401
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:14,379
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

402
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:23,680
Ah, right, then. Mm, right.

403
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,517
Okay. Gryffindor!

404
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,112
Draco Malfoy.

405
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,869
Slytherin!

406
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:49,706
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

407
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,501
Susan Bones.

408
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,884
Ah!

409
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,178
Harry, what is it?

410
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:06,139
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

411
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,808
Let's see...

412
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:12,396
I know! Hufflepuff!

413
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,566
Ronald Weasley.

414
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:35,419
Ha, another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

415
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:38,422
Gryffindor!

416
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:47,097
Harry Potter.

417
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,201
Hm, difficult, very difficult.

418
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:12,372
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

419
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:14,875
There's talent, oh, yes.

420
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:18,920
And a thirst to prove yourself.

421
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:21,298
But where to put you?

422
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:24,384
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

423
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:28,263
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

424
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:33,310
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

425
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,899
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

426
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:43,820
- No? Well, if you're sure.
- Please, no.

427
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,822
Better be...

428
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:47,991
...Gryffindor!

429
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:16,311
Your attention, please.

430
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:21,066
Let the feast begin.

431
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,198
Wow.

432
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,543
I'm half and half.

433
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:43,004
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

434
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:46,716
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

435
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:51,513
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

436
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,975
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

437
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:57,102
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

438
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:02,899
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

439
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:09,739
Hello! How are you?

440
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,368
Welcome to Gryffindor.

441
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,922
It's the Bloody Baron!

442
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:33,388
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

443
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:39,019
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

444
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,941
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

445
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,944
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

446
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:51,656
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

447
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,950
Like this.

448
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,797
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

449
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:12,302
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

450
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:15,931
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

451
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:20,310
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

452
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:35,241
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

453
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,119
That picture's moving.

454
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:41,831
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

455
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,919
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

456
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,672
Welcome to Hogwarts.

457
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,424
Who's that?

458
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:06,272
Password?

459
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,526
Caput Draconis.

460
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:13,822
Wow.

461
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:21,162
Follow me, everyone.
Keep up. Quickly, come on.

462
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,292
Gather around here.

463
00:51:28,003 --> 00:51:31,297
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

464
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:35,885
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

465
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:39,264
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

466
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:49,084
Made it!

467
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:53,713
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

468
00:52:56,966 --> 00:53:01,930
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

469
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:06,434
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

470
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:09,854
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

471
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:15,819
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

472
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:29,666
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

473
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:33,503
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

474
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:37,465
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

475
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:40,760
However, for those select few...

476
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:45,014
...who possess the predisposition...

477
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:51,980
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

478
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:55,108
...and ensnare the senses.

479
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,861
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

480
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:03,992
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

481
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:12,917
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

482
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:19,048
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

483
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,218
...to not pay attention.

484
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,810
Mr. Potter.

485
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,857
Our new celebrity.

486
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:43,823
What would I get if I added root of
asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

487
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:49,495
You don't know? Let's try again.

488
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:54,334
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

489
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:57,003
I don't know, sir.

490
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:01,090
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

491
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:05,929
I don't know, sir.

492
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,264
Pity.

493
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:14,229
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

494
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:15,939
...is it, Mr. Potter?

495
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,942
Clearly, Hermione knows.

496
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:21,861
It seems a pity not to ask her.

497
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:24,781
Silence.

498
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,752
Put your hand down, you silly girl.

499
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,300
For your information, Potter...

500
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:47,387
...asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so powerful...

501
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,847
...it is known as
the Draught of the Living Dead.

502
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:53,059
A bezoar is a stone
taken from the stomach of a goat...

503
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:55,228
...and it will save you from most poisons.

504
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:58,356
As for monkshood and wolfsbane,
they are the same plant...

505
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:01,609
...which also goes by the name of aconite.

506
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,697
Well...

507
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:09,951
...why aren't you all copying this down?

508
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:21,838
And Gryffindors...

509
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:26,509
...note that five points
will be taken from your house...

510
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:30,305
...for your classmate's cheek.

511
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:52,035
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum</i>

512
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:54,746
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

513
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,749
What's Seamus trying to do to the water?

514
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:02,754
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

515
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,387
Mail's here.

516
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,631
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

517
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,762
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

518
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:58,476
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

519
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,146
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

520
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,900
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

521
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:09,779
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

522
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:15,743
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

523
00:58:15,952 --> 00:58:21,666
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

524
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:26,129
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

525
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:38,808
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

526
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,811
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

527
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:45,565
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

528
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:49,694
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

529
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:55,491
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

530
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,660
Up!

531
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:02,206
- Up.
- Up.

532
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,501
Up. Up!

533
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,712
With feeling.

534
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:08,963
Up!

535
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,882
- Up. Up.
- Up. Up.

536
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:15,469
Up! Oh!

537
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:18,514
Shut up, Harry.

538
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:23,394
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

539
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:27,607
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

540
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:32,904
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

541
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:36,991
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

542
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,495
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

543
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,874
On my whistle. Three, two...

544
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,669
Mr. Longbottom.

545
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:56,177
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

546
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:57,637
Neville!

547
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:04,018
Come back down this instant!

548
01:00:13,945 --> 01:00:16,447
Mr. Longbo--

549
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,875
Whoa!

550
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:32,797
Ow!

551
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:35,383
Everyone out of the way!

552
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,099
Is he all right?

553
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:49,146
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

554
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:55,111
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

555
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:58,990
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

556
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:04,453
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

557
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,580
Did you see his face?

558
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:10,626
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

559
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:13,337
Give it here, Malfoy.

560
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:17,842
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

561
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:24,515
How about on the roof?

562
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:29,520
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

563
01:01:32,023 --> 01:01:35,860
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

564
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:38,988
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

565
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,198
What an idiot.

566
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:48,039
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

567
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:50,374
Is that so?

568
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,838
Have it your way, then.

569
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:32,208
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

570
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,418
Harry Potter!

571
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,421
Follow me.

572
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,352
You wait here.

573
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:58,401
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

574
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,444
Yes, of course.

575
01:03:06,117 --> 01:03:11,872
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

576
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:17,461
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

577
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,922
I always knew he'd do well.

578
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:24,427
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

579
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:29,473
- You must be the youngest player in--
- A century, McGonagall says.

580
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,976
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

581
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:34,645
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

582
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:38,607
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

583
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,485
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

584
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:45,656
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

585
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,617
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

586
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:54,498
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

587
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,918
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

588
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:03,132
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

589
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,014
Whoa.

590
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:15,519
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

591
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,522
I didn't know.

592
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:27,656
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

593
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,159
Who doesn't?

594
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:33,204
What's happening?

595
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:37,625
The staircases change, remember?

596
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:47,551
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

597
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:58,562
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

598
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:00,981
We're not supposed to be here.

599
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:05,069
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

600
01:05:06,237 --> 01:05:07,863
Let's go.

601
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:12,952
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

602
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:20,084
Quick, let's hide through that door!

603
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:27,258
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

604
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:29,593
Move over!

605
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,721
<i>Alohomora.</i>

606
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,516
Get in.

607
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,851
<i>Alohomora?</i>

608
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,604
<i>Standard Book of Spells,</i>
chapter seven.

609
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:44,191
Anyone here, my sweet?

610
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:51,448
Come on.

611
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:54,868
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

612
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:58,622
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

613
01:06:24,315 --> 01:06:29,820
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

614
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:33,657
Didn't you see what it was standing on?

615
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:38,078
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

616
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:41,165
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

617
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:45,044
It was standing on
a trap door. It wasn't there by accident.

618
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:48,797
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

619
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:52,968
That's right. Now, if you two
don't mind, I'm going to bed...

620
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:56,805
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

621
01:06:57,014 --> 01:07:00,142
Or worse, expelled.

622
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:07,650
She needs to sort out her priorities.

623
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:16,492
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

624
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:22,373
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

625
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:31,632
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

626
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:37,805
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

627
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:42,393
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

628
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:47,064
I think so. What are those?

629
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:51,527
You better take this.

630
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,373
Careful now, it's coming back.

631
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:14,591
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

632
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,846
Uh-oh.

633
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:33,527
What was that?

634
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:38,031
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

635
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,744
But you are a Seeker.

636
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:49,918
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

637
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,671
The Golden Snitch.

638
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,883
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

639
01:08:56,091 --> 01:09:00,095
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

640
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:02,264
What do I do with it?

641
01:09:02,473 --> 01:09:05,726
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

642
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:08,437
You catch this, the game's over.

643
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:12,608
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

644
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,491
Whoa.

645
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:26,997
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

646
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:31,168
...or the ability to make objects fly.

647
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:33,796
Do you have your feathers? Good.

648
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:39,176
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

649
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:42,721
The swish and flick. Everyone.

650
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:48,852
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

651
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:53,857
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>
Off you go, then.

652
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:57,444
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

653
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,030
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

654
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,700
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

655
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:08,121
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

656
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:14,336
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's <i>Leviosa,</i> not <i>Leviosar.</i>

657
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:19,132
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

658
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:23,470
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

659
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:36,567
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

660
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:38,485
Splendid!

661
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:42,239
Well done, dear.

662
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:50,581
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

663
01:10:57,087 --> 01:11:01,341
"It's <i>Leviosa,</i> not <i>Leviosar."</i>

664
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:06,930
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

665
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:10,100
I think she heard you.

666
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,881
Where's Hermione?

667
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:44,217
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

668
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:48,472
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

669
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:56,605
Troll in the dungeon!

670
01:11:56,855 --> 01:12:00,150
Troll in the dungeon!

671
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,322
Thought you ought to know.

672
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,998
Silence!

673
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:20,671
Everyone will please not panic!

674
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:22,923
Now...

675
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:27,678
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

676
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:33,183
Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.

677
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:47,406
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

678
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:49,366
How could a troll get in?

679
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:54,705
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

680
01:12:54,955 --> 01:12:58,959
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

681
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:14,307
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

682
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:20,355
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

683
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:53,764
Hermione, move!

684
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:01,271
Help! Help!

685
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:05,358
Hey, pea brain!

686
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:19,623
Help!

687
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,877
Whoa!

688
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,553
Ugh.

689
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:43,146
Do something!

690
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:48,568
- What?
- Anything!

691
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,613
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

692
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:54,157
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

693
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:07,087
Cool.

694
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:34,322
Is it dead?

695
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:38,451
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

696
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:47,043
Ugh. Troll boogers.

697
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:53,091
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

698
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:57,888
- Well, what it is--
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

699
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:01,308
Miss Granger?

700
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:07,230
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

701
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,357
But I was wrong.

702
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,234
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me...

703
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:14,613
...I'd probably be dead.

704
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:20,160
Be that as it may,
it was an extremely foolish thing to do.

705
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:25,999
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

706
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:29,252
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

707
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:33,006
...for your serious lack of judgment.

708
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,508
As for you two gentlemen...

709
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:39,137
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

710
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:42,766
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

711
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:45,560
...and live to tell the tale.

712
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:48,271
Five points...

713
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:52,776
...will be awarded to each of you...

714
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:57,405
...for sheer dumb luck.

715
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:06,790
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

716
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:17,842
Good of you to
get us out of trouble like that.

717
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:20,345
Mind you, we did save her life.

718
01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:25,183
Mind you, she might not have
needed saving if you hadn't insulted her.

719
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:27,894
What are friends for?

720
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:33,525
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

721
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:36,945
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

722
01:17:37,112 --> 01:17:39,364
I'm not hungry.

723
01:17:39,948 --> 01:17:45,578
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

724
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:48,957
A game of Quidditch should be easy work.

725
01:17:49,124 --> 01:17:52,294
Even if it is against Slytherin.

726
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:03,388
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

727
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:07,934
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

728
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:10,812
...so he could get past that dog.

729
01:18:11,021 --> 01:18:13,773
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

730
01:18:14,024 --> 01:18:16,234
But why would anyone go near that dog?

731
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:20,155
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

732
01:18:20,322 --> 01:18:23,616
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

733
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:24,951
You're saying--

734
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,664
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

735
01:18:42,802 --> 01:18:46,765
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

736
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:48,850
Let's open it.

737
01:18:59,027 --> 01:19:00,278
It's a broomstick.

738
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:05,200
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

739
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,703
But who--?

740
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,852
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

741
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:36,731
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

742
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:40,402
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

743
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:43,405
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

744
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:46,408
Woke up in hospital a week later.

745
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:12,016
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

746
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:16,604
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

747
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,611
Gryffindor!

748
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:49,679
The players take their positions...

749
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:53,683
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

750
01:20:53,892 --> 01:20:57,228
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

751
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:00,273
...from all of you!

752
01:21:05,403 --> 01:21:08,323
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

753
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:11,242
Remember, the Snitch is worth 150 points.

754
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:15,246
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

755
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:25,507
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

756
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:48,988
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

757
01:21:51,241 --> 01:21:53,493
Yes-- Whoa.

758
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,453
Well done!

759
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:05,547
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

760
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:40,373
- Yes!
- Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

761
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:56,055
Give me that!

762
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:30,131
Take that side!

763
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,097
Whoa. Whoa!

764
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:22,850
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

765
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:33,986
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

766
01:24:34,195 --> 01:24:38,533
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

767
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:01,889
Come on, Hermione!

768
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:19,741
<i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i>

769
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:29,876
Fire! You're on fire!

770
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:49,896
Go, go, go, go!

771
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:44,242
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

772
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:46,786
He's got the Snitch!

773
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:51,082
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

774
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,959
Gryffindor wins!

775
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:59,090
Oh, no.

776
01:27:01,843 --> 01:27:03,135
Yes!

777
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:40,798
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

778
01:27:41,007 --> 01:27:44,886
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

779
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:47,555
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

780
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:51,392
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

781
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:56,188
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

782
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:57,398
Yes?

783
01:27:57,607 --> 01:28:01,736
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

784
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,324
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

785
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:09,994
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

786
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:15,583
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

787
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:19,378
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

788
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,839
Exactly.

789
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:25,259
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

790
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:30,139
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

791
01:28:30,348 --> 01:28:35,436
What that dog is guarding is between
Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

792
01:28:35,645 --> 01:28:37,063
Nicholas Flamel?

793
01:28:38,064 --> 01:28:42,777
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

794
01:28:42,944 --> 01:28:47,073
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

795
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:49,283
I don't know.

796
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:10,972
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

797
01:29:11,222 --> 01:29:13,975
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

798
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:16,978
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

799
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:20,147
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

800
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:37,081
Knight to e5.

801
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:46,924
Queen to e5.

802
01:29:52,513 --> 01:29:53,973
That's totally barbaric!

803
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:58,144
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

804
01:29:58,352 --> 01:29:59,812
I see you haven't.

805
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:05,317
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

806
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:09,363
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

807
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,950
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

808
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:16,662
We've looked a hundred times!

809
01:30:17,288 --> 01:30:22,543
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

810
01:30:24,754 --> 01:30:27,673
I think we've had a bad influence on her.

811
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:34,555
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

812
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:47,735
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

813
01:30:47,902 --> 01:30:50,154
What are you wearing?

814
01:30:50,738 --> 01:30:54,408
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

815
01:30:55,576 --> 01:30:57,995
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

816
01:31:05,419 --> 01:31:07,505
There they are.

817
01:31:18,516 --> 01:31:22,019
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

818
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:26,398
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

819
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:46,919
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

820
01:31:47,211 --> 01:31:50,131
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

821
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,343
Whoa!

822
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:56,846
My body's gone!

823
01:31:57,054 --> 01:32:00,641
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

824
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:03,102
I'm invisible?

825
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:07,982
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

826
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:13,237
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

827
01:32:41,307 --> 01:32:47,188
<i>Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i>

828
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:53,194
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

829
01:33:12,046 --> 01:33:13,964
Who's there?

830
01:33:20,054 --> 01:33:25,726
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

831
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:36,862
Who is it? Show yourself.

832
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:25,411
Severus, I...

833
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:29,957
You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.

834
01:34:30,124 --> 01:34:34,878
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

835
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:55,316
We'll have another little chat soon.

836
01:34:55,524 --> 01:35:00,988
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

837
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:05,659
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

838
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:11,248
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

839
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,175
Mum?

840
01:36:48,429 --> 01:36:50,431
Dad?

841
01:37:25,174 --> 01:37:30,137
Ron, you've really gotta
see this! Ron, you've gotta see this!

842
01:37:31,972 --> 01:37:34,808
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

843
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:38,645
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

844
01:37:45,319 --> 01:37:49,656
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

845
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:53,076
I only see us.

846
01:37:53,327 --> 01:37:56,663
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

847
01:37:56,830 --> 01:38:02,794
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

848
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:05,631
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

849
01:38:05,839 --> 01:38:10,010
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

850
01:38:11,178 --> 01:38:13,639
I look good.

851
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:18,101
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

852
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:23,273
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

853
01:38:37,162 --> 01:38:40,415
- Do you like yours, Ron?
- Are you staying here for Christmas?

854
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:43,001
Yeah, actually I am.

855
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:46,797
- Ron? Ron?
- I'll be right back.

856
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:59,393
Wanna play chess?

857
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:03,105
- No.
- Wanna go and visit Hagrid?

858
01:39:03,272 --> 01:39:04,773
No.

859
01:39:05,274 --> 01:39:08,819
Harry, I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

860
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:12,406
There's something not right
about that mirror.

861
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:42,519
Back again, Harry?

862
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:48,108
I see that you,
like many before you...

863
01:39:48,317 --> 01:39:52,487
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

864
01:39:52,821 --> 01:39:56,992
I trust by now you realize what it does.

865
01:39:58,285 --> 01:40:00,829
Let me give you a clue.

866
01:40:01,371 --> 01:40:03,498
The happiest man on earth...

867
01:40:03,749 --> 01:40:07,085
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

868
01:40:07,294 --> 01:40:09,629
...exactly as he is.

869
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:14,885
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

870
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:17,846
Yes. And no.

871
01:40:18,889 --> 01:40:21,350
It shows us nothing more or less...

872
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:27,522
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

873
01:40:27,773 --> 01:40:32,444
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

874
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:36,531
...you see them standing beside you.

875
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:39,159
But remember this, Harry.

876
01:40:39,409 --> 01:40:45,290
This mirror gives us neither knowledge...

877
01:40:45,499 --> 01:40:47,626
...or truth.

878
01:40:48,585 --> 01:40:54,633
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

879
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:59,805
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

880
01:41:00,013 --> 01:41:01,932
And I must ask you...

881
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:06,812
...not to go looking for it again.

882
01:41:07,521 --> 01:41:10,649
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

883
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:14,111
...and forget to live.

884
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,710
Hi, Hedwig.

885
01:42:13,837 --> 01:42:17,340
Look at you playing with your cards.
Pathetic.

886
01:42:17,883 --> 01:42:20,177
We've got final exams coming up soon.

887
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:22,804
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

888
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:26,850
All right, what's the three most crucial
ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?

889
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:28,894
I forgot.

890
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,980
And what do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

891
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:34,232
- Copy off you?
- No, you won't.

892
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:36,526
Besides, according to
Professor McGonagall...

893
01:42:36,693 --> 01:42:40,405
...we're to be given special quills
bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.

894
01:42:40,572 --> 01:42:43,950
That's insulting!
It's as if they don't trust us!

895
01:42:44,117 --> 01:42:46,411
Dumbledore again.

896
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:54,628
- Leg-Locker Curse.
- Malfoy.

897
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:02,928
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

898
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:06,806
How? I can barely stand at all.

899
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:08,975
I'll do the countercurse.

900
01:43:09,142 --> 01:43:10,352
No, that's all I need.

901
01:43:10,519 --> 01:43:13,605
You to set my bloody kneecaps on fire.

902
01:43:13,772 --> 01:43:17,067
I don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

903
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:20,403
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

904
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:24,449
...my eyebrows have completely grown back.

905
01:43:28,495 --> 01:43:29,788
I found him.

906
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:32,332
"Dumbledore is particularly famous...

907
01:43:32,499 --> 01:43:35,794
...for his defeat of
the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945...

908
01:43:35,961 --> 01:43:38,088
- Go on.
- ...for his discovery of the 12 uses...

909
01:43:38,255 --> 01:43:42,634
...of dragon blood and his work on alchemy
with his partner, Nicholas Flamel."

910
01:43:42,801 --> 01:43:46,137
I knew the name sounded familiar.
I read it on the train that day.

911
01:43:46,304 --> 01:43:48,014
Follow me.

912
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:56,147
Hey, wait, where are you going?

913
01:43:57,983 --> 01:43:59,943
What about the countercurse?

914
01:44:02,779 --> 01:44:08,410
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

915
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:11,788
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

916
01:44:11,997 --> 01:44:13,999
This is light?

917
01:44:18,545 --> 01:44:21,006
Of course! Here it is!

918
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:25,176
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

919
01:44:25,427 --> 01:44:26,678
- The what?
- The what?

920
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:30,307
Honestly, don't you two read?

921
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:35,020
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

922
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:37,856
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

923
01:44:38,023 --> 01:44:42,027
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

924
01:44:42,235 --> 01:44:44,404
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

925
01:44:44,654 --> 01:44:46,740
- I know what it means!
- Shh.

926
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:52,370
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

927
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:57,709
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

928
01:44:59,419 --> 01:45:01,254
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

929
01:45:01,421 --> 01:45:04,424
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

930
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:27,030
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

931
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:29,949
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

932
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,577
Oh.

933
01:45:34,621 --> 01:45:39,793
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

934
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:42,796
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

935
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:47,342
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

936
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:48,635
What?

937
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:52,263
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

938
01:45:52,472 --> 01:45:55,141
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

939
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:59,229
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

940
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:02,065
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

941
01:46:02,315 --> 01:46:05,360
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

942
01:46:05,568 --> 01:46:07,654
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

943
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:11,491
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

944
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:15,328
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

945
01:46:29,175 --> 01:46:34,305
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

946
01:46:34,514 --> 01:46:36,516
I know what that is!

947
01:46:36,766 --> 01:46:39,394
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

948
01:46:39,769 --> 01:46:43,022
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

949
01:46:43,189 --> 01:46:47,318
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

950
01:47:09,549 --> 01:47:11,718
Is that...

951
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:13,720
...a dragon?

952
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:18,349
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

953
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:21,436
My brother works with these in Romania.

954
01:47:21,644 --> 01:47:26,524
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

955
01:47:27,192 --> 01:47:28,943
Hello, Norbert.

956
01:47:29,235 --> 01:47:33,573
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

957
01:47:34,324 --> 01:47:36,743
Don't you, Norbert?

958
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:46,878
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

959
01:47:50,757 --> 01:47:52,842
Who's that?

960
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:56,596
Malfoy.

961
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:58,765
Oh, dear.

962
01:48:00,517 --> 01:48:05,271
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

963
01:48:05,522 --> 01:48:09,567
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

964
01:48:09,776 --> 01:48:13,863
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

965
01:48:14,113 --> 01:48:16,282
Good evening.

966
01:48:19,953 --> 01:48:22,872
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

967
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:26,626
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

968
01:48:26,793 --> 01:48:31,714
Therefore, as punishment for your
actions, 50 points will be taken.

969
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:34,259
- 50?!
- Each.

970
01:48:35,301 --> 01:48:37,637
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

971
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:41,224
...all four of you will receive detention.

972
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:45,103
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

973
01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:47,647
I thought you said the four of us.

974
01:48:47,814 --> 01:48:50,316
No, you heard me correctly.

975
01:48:50,567 --> 01:48:55,572
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

976
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:58,992
You will join your classmates in detention.

977
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:14,173
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

978
01:49:14,424 --> 01:49:19,137
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

979
01:49:19,345 --> 01:49:22,181
God, I miss the screaming.

980
01:49:24,684 --> 01:49:28,021
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

981
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:33,568
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

982
01:49:35,653 --> 01:49:38,615
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

983
01:49:40,074 --> 01:49:45,079
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

984
01:49:47,332 --> 01:49:49,375
Norbert's gone.

985
01:49:49,959 --> 01:49:53,504
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

986
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:57,050
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

987
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:59,552
What if he don't like Romania?

988
01:49:59,719 --> 01:50:04,015
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

989
01:50:04,641 --> 01:50:09,896
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

990
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:12,482
Got to have your wits about you.

991
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:18,363
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

992
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:22,408
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

993
01:50:24,202 --> 01:50:25,411
...werewolves.

994
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:29,165
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

995
01:50:29,374 --> 01:50:32,043
You can be sure of that.

996
01:50:34,003 --> 01:50:35,421
Nighty-night.

997
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:40,843
Right. Let's go.

998
01:51:19,048 --> 01:51:21,467
Hagrid, what is that?

999
01:51:21,676 --> 01:51:25,054
What we're here for.
See that?

1000
01:51:25,555 --> 01:51:30,935
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

1001
01:51:31,477 --> 01:51:36,065
Now, this one's been hurt bad by something.

1002
01:51:43,573 --> 01:51:49,328
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

1003
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:52,665
- Ron, Hermione, come with me.
- Okay.

1004
01:51:53,124 --> 01:51:56,419
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

1005
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:59,964
Okay. Then I get Fang.

1006
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:05,845
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

1007
01:52:09,515 --> 01:52:14,520
Wait till my father hears
about this. This is servant's stuff.

1008
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:18,691
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

1009
01:52:18,858 --> 01:52:21,194
I'm not scared, Potter.

1010
01:52:22,612 --> 01:52:24,530
Do you hear that?

1011
01:52:27,116 --> 01:52:28,534
Come on, Fang.

1012
01:52:28,743 --> 01:52:30,244
Scared!

1013
01:52:55,228 --> 01:52:57,396
What is it, Fang?

1014
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:13,264
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

1015
01:54:13,472 --> 01:54:17,476
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

1016
01:54:17,643 --> 01:54:20,438
What was that thing you saved me from?

1017
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:25,985
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

1018
01:54:26,152 --> 01:54:31,741
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

1019
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:36,996
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

1020
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:42,084
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

1021
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:44,086
A cursed life.

1022
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:48,257
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

1023
01:54:48,466 --> 01:54:53,429
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

1024
01:54:53,763 --> 01:54:57,683
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

1025
01:54:57,892 --> 01:55:03,022
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

1026
01:55:03,898 --> 01:55:05,441
The Philosopher's Stone.

1027
01:55:06,859 --> 01:55:08,778
Harry!

1028
01:55:09,362 --> 01:55:13,866
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

1029
01:55:14,033 --> 01:55:16,202
You all right there, Harry?

1030
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:21,666
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

1031
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:26,379
You're safe now. Good luck.

1032
01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:38,140
You mean, You-Know-Who
is out there right now in the Forest?

1033
01:55:38,349 --> 01:55:41,143
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

1034
01:55:41,352 --> 01:55:44,230
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

1035
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:48,859
Snape doesn't want the Stone
for himself. He wants it for Voldemort.

1036
01:55:49,068 --> 01:55:53,572
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

1037
01:55:53,823 --> 01:55:55,408
He'll come back.

1038
01:55:55,574 --> 01:55:57,368
But if he comes back...

1039
01:55:57,576 --> 01:56:01,580
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

1040
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:06,085
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

1041
01:56:06,335 --> 01:56:09,922
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

1042
01:56:10,089 --> 01:56:13,718
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1043
01:56:14,093 --> 01:56:18,973
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1044
01:56:19,724 --> 01:56:24,854
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

1045
01:56:25,062 --> 01:56:29,108
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

1046
01:56:34,864 --> 01:56:40,286
I'd heard Hogwarts' final
exams were frightful, but that was fun.

1047
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:44,123
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1048
01:56:44,373 --> 01:56:49,545
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

1049
01:56:49,754 --> 01:56:52,423
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

1050
01:56:52,631 --> 01:56:56,135
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

1051
01:57:03,768 --> 01:57:06,228
- Of course!
- What is it?

1052
01:57:06,437 --> 01:57:10,149
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

1053
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:13,486
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

1054
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:16,322
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

1055
01:57:16,572 --> 01:57:18,824
Why didn't I see it before?

1056
01:57:24,413 --> 01:57:27,917
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

1057
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:30,836
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1058
01:57:31,087 --> 01:57:33,672
You and this stranger must have talked.

1059
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:37,802
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

1060
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:42,014
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

1061
01:57:42,181 --> 01:57:46,685
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

1062
01:57:47,103 --> 01:57:51,273
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

1063
01:57:51,482 --> 01:57:57,113
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

1064
01:57:57,321 --> 01:58:02,785
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1065
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:07,123
I shouldn't have told you that.

1066
01:58:07,373 --> 01:58:09,583
Where are you going?

1067
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:19,343
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

1068
01:58:19,802 --> 01:58:22,388
I'm afraid he's not here.

1069
01:58:22,638 --> 01:58:26,892
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

1070
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:32,440
He's gone? But this is important!
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

1071
01:58:34,233 --> 01:58:37,987
- How do you know--?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

1072
01:58:38,612 --> 01:58:43,826
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

1073
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:48,330
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1074
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:59,425
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

1075
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:02,261
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1076
01:59:02,511 --> 01:59:06,390
- And with Dumbledore gone--
- Good afternoon.

1077
01:59:08,434 --> 01:59:11,520
What would three young Gryffindors...

1078
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:16,066
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1079
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:24,366
- We were just--
- You ought to be careful.

1080
01:59:24,909 --> 01:59:26,869
People will think you're...

1081
01:59:31,165 --> 01:59:33,876
...up to something.

1082
01:59:44,178 --> 01:59:46,180
Now what do we do?

1083
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:50,142
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1084
02:00:03,906 --> 02:00:05,324
Trevor.

1085
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:09,119
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

1086
02:00:09,328 --> 02:00:14,792
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1087
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,963
- Neville, listen. We were--
- No, I won't let you!

1088
02:00:19,213 --> 02:00:23,801
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

1089
02:00:24,009 --> 02:00:28,305
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

1090
02:00:36,272 --> 02:00:40,025
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

1091
02:00:40,317 --> 02:00:43,946
Brilliant, but scary.

1092
02:00:44,613 --> 02:00:46,657
Let's go.

1093
02:00:46,865 --> 02:00:51,120
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

1094
02:00:56,542 --> 02:01:00,504
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

1095
02:01:04,383 --> 02:01:06,385
<i>Alohomora.</i>

1096
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:21,025
Wait a minute. He's...

1097
02:01:22,234 --> 02:01:24,403
...snoring.

1098
02:01:26,905 --> 02:01:32,411
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1099
02:01:34,038 --> 02:01:37,041
It's got horrible breath.

1100
02:01:39,585 --> 02:01:41,712
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

1101
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,339
Come on!

1102
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:49,428
Okay. Push.

1103
02:02:12,618 --> 02:02:16,246
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1104
02:02:16,455 --> 02:02:21,460
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1105
02:02:22,252 --> 02:02:25,714
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1106
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:28,258
The harp.

1107
02:02:28,926 --> 02:02:31,637
It's stopped playing.

1108
02:02:33,055 --> 02:02:37,434
Ugh. Yuck!

1109
02:02:41,647 --> 02:02:42,815
Jump!

1110
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,245
Whoa.

1111
02:02:56,995 --> 02:03:00,624
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1112
02:03:00,791 --> 02:03:03,085
Whoa!

1113
02:03:15,013 --> 02:03:18,142
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1114
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:22,020
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1115
02:03:22,271 --> 02:03:27,276
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1116
02:03:29,528 --> 02:03:30,863
Hermione!

1117
02:03:31,447 --> 02:03:35,200
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1118
02:03:35,451 --> 02:03:39,955
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1119
02:03:43,834 --> 02:03:45,961
Harry!

1120
02:03:47,045 --> 02:03:50,382
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1121
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:53,635
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1122
02:03:53,844 --> 02:03:56,388
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1123
02:03:56,555 --> 02:03:59,516
I remember reading something in Herbology.

1124
02:04:00,392 --> 02:04:04,229
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1125
02:04:04,438 --> 02:04:08,817
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1126
02:04:09,067 --> 02:04:11,069
<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

1127
02:04:19,203 --> 02:04:21,747
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1128
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,960
Lucky we didn't panic.

1129
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:31,215
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.

1130
02:04:32,841 --> 02:04:34,343
What is that?

1131
02:04:34,551 --> 02:04:38,222
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1132
02:04:51,401 --> 02:04:54,863
Curious.
I've never seen birds like these.

1133
02:04:55,072 --> 02:04:58,700
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1134
02:04:58,909 --> 02:05:02,371
And I'll bet one of them fits that door.

1135
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:10,462
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1136
02:05:16,301 --> 02:05:18,387
Strange.

1137
02:05:18,804 --> 02:05:21,098
<i>Alohomora!</i>

1138
02:05:24,059 --> 02:05:26,311
Well, it was worth a try.

1139
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:29,773
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1140
02:05:29,982 --> 02:05:33,902
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1141
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:37,531
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1142
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:43,453
What's wrong?

1143
02:05:44,329 --> 02:05:45,831
It's too simple.

1144
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:50,794
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1145
02:05:51,003 --> 02:05:54,548
You're the youngest Seeker in a century.

1146
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:14,359
This complicates things a bit.

1147
02:06:35,672 --> 02:06:37,591
Catch the key!

1148
02:06:42,012 --> 02:06:43,889
Hurry up!

1149
02:07:16,421 --> 02:07:21,093
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1150
02:07:21,259 --> 02:07:24,429
Where are we? A graveyard.

1151
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:27,432
This is no graveyard.

1152
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:37,901
It's a chessboard.

1153
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:51,790
There's the door.

1154
02:08:03,802 --> 02:08:05,303
Now what do we do?

1155
02:08:05,721 --> 02:08:09,808
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1156
02:08:10,434 --> 02:08:14,187
Harry, you take the empty bishop's square.

1157
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:18,734
Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle.

1158
02:08:18,984 --> 02:08:22,988
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1159
02:08:30,203 --> 02:08:31,913
What happens now?

1160
02:08:32,706 --> 02:08:35,709
Well, white moves first.

1161
02:08:35,917 --> 02:08:37,794
And then...

1162
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:40,797
...we play.

1163
02:08:51,349 --> 02:08:56,438
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1164
02:08:56,688 --> 02:09:00,233
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1165
02:09:00,609 --> 02:09:03,528
You there, d5.

1166
02:09:18,168 --> 02:09:19,753
Yes, Hermione.

1167
02:09:19,961 --> 02:09:25,050
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1168
02:09:30,972 --> 02:09:33,475
Castle to e4!

1169
02:09:37,062 --> 02:09:39,397
Pawn to c3!

1170
02:10:24,025 --> 02:10:28,029
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1171
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:32,951
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1172
02:10:33,618 --> 02:10:35,954
Then you're free to check the king.

1173
02:10:36,121 --> 02:10:38,874
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1174
02:10:39,457 --> 02:10:44,129
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1175
02:10:44,379 --> 02:10:48,133
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1176
02:10:48,341 --> 02:10:51,928
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1177
02:10:52,429 --> 02:10:55,140
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1178
02:11:05,442 --> 02:11:08,361
Knight to h3.

1179
02:11:29,299 --> 02:11:31,301
Check.

1180
02:12:00,455 --> 02:12:02,207
Ron!

1181
02:12:02,457 --> 02:12:08,213
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1182
02:12:23,311 --> 02:12:24,562
Checkmate.

1183
02:12:44,541 --> 02:12:47,043
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1184
02:12:47,252 --> 02:12:51,089
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1185
02:12:51,339 --> 02:12:53,216
I have to go on.

1186
02:12:53,717 --> 02:12:59,597
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1187
02:12:59,848 --> 02:13:02,350
Not as good as you.

1188
02:13:03,184 --> 02:13:08,023
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1189
02:13:09,232 --> 02:13:14,863
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1190
02:13:52,942 --> 02:13:54,611
You?

1191
02:13:55,403 --> 02:13:59,240
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

1192
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:02,494
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1193
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:05,830
Next to him, who would suspect...

1194
02:14:06,039 --> 02:14:09,959
...poor, stuttering Professor Quirrell?

1195
02:14:10,168 --> 02:14:15,548
But that day, during the Quidditch
match, Snape tried to kill me.

1196
02:14:15,757 --> 02:14:18,551
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1197
02:14:19,052 --> 02:14:23,181
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1198
02:14:23,431 --> 02:14:25,642
...I would have succeeded.

1199
02:14:25,850 --> 02:14:28,853
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1200
02:14:29,062 --> 02:14:31,272
Snape was trying to save me?

1201
02:14:31,481 --> 02:14:36,820
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1202
02:14:37,028 --> 02:14:41,282
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1203
02:14:41,491 --> 02:14:44,494
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1204
02:14:45,078 --> 02:14:50,041
While everyone ran about, he went
to the third floor to head me off.

1205
02:14:50,959 --> 02:14:54,462
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1206
02:14:55,463 --> 02:15:00,718
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1207
02:15:00,885 --> 02:15:04,973
I'm never alone. Never.

1208
02:15:05,181 --> 02:15:09,227
Now, what does this mirror do?

1209
02:15:10,854 --> 02:15:12,981
I see what I desire.

1210
02:15:13,523 --> 02:15:17,902
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1211
02:15:18,153 --> 02:15:20,321
Use the boy.

1212
02:15:21,114 --> 02:15:25,034
Come here, Potter! Now!

1213
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:41,134
Tell me, what do you see?

1214
02:16:06,284 --> 02:16:08,703
What is it? What do you see?

1215
02:16:08,912 --> 02:16:14,083
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1216
02:16:14,292 --> 02:16:15,793
He lies.

1217
02:16:16,294 --> 02:16:20,048
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1218
02:16:20,256 --> 02:16:24,636
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1219
02:16:24,886 --> 02:16:28,890
I have strength enough for this.

1220
02:16:47,075 --> 02:16:49,953
Harry Potter...

1221
02:16:50,161 --> 02:16:52,497
...we meet again.

1222
02:16:52,705 --> 02:16:54,123
Voldemort.

1223
02:16:54,332 --> 02:16:58,294
Yes. You see what I've become?

1224
02:16:58,503 --> 02:17:02,131
See what I must do to survive?

1225
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:06,469
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1226
02:17:07,136 --> 02:17:10,473
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1227
02:17:10,682 --> 02:17:14,352
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1228
02:17:14,519 --> 02:17:18,106
But there is something that can.

1229
02:17:18,314 --> 02:17:23,987
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1230
02:17:24,362 --> 02:17:25,863
Stop him!

1231
02:17:30,952 --> 02:17:33,705
Don't be a fool.

1232
02:17:34,205 --> 02:17:37,333
Why suffer an horrific death...

1233
02:17:37,542 --> 02:17:41,170
...when you can join me and live?

1234
02:17:41,379 --> 02:17:42,463
Never!

1235
02:17:44,465 --> 02:17:49,262
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1236
02:17:50,013 --> 02:17:53,308
Tell me, Harry...

1237
02:17:53,558 --> 02:17:57,395
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1238
02:17:57,687 --> 02:17:59,772
Together...

1239
02:17:59,981 --> 02:18:02,525
...we can bring them back.

1240
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:07,655
All I ask is for something in return.

1241
02:18:14,370 --> 02:18:17,498
That's it, Harry.

1242
02:18:18,374 --> 02:18:22,253
There is no good and evil.

1243
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:25,423
There is only power...

1244
02:18:25,673 --> 02:18:29,802
...and those too weak to seek it.

1245
02:18:30,428 --> 02:18:35,516
Together, we'll do extraordinary things.

1246
02:18:35,933 --> 02:18:38,186
Just give me the Stone!

1247
02:18:40,813 --> 02:18:41,939
You liar!

1248
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:44,317
Kill him!

1249
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:13,137
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1250
02:20:58,451 --> 02:21:00,953
Good afternoon, Harry.

1251
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:07,585
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1252
02:21:07,752 --> 02:21:13,758
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1253
02:21:14,008 --> 02:21:18,763
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1254
02:21:21,098 --> 02:21:24,769
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1255
02:21:24,977 --> 02:21:27,772
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1256
02:21:28,022 --> 02:21:31,025
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1257
02:21:31,234 --> 02:21:36,113
Fine. They're both just fine.

1258
02:21:36,697 --> 02:21:39,492
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1259
02:21:39,784 --> 02:21:42,620
The Stone has been destroyed.

1260
02:21:42,912 --> 02:21:47,124
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1261
02:21:47,291 --> 02:21:51,295
...and agreed it was best all around.

1262
02:21:51,504 --> 02:21:55,299
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1263
02:21:57,385 --> 02:22:02,890
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1264
02:22:03,099 --> 02:22:06,310
But yes, he will die.

1265
02:22:06,519 --> 02:22:08,980
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1266
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:11,732
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1267
02:22:11,941 --> 02:22:16,028
You see, only a person...

1268
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:20,241
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1269
02:22:20,491 --> 02:22:25,037
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1270
02:22:25,997 --> 02:22:29,500
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1271
02:22:29,667 --> 02:22:34,755
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1272
02:22:36,173 --> 02:22:41,429
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1273
02:22:41,637 --> 02:22:43,973
I'm afraid...

1274
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:49,437
...there are ways in which he can return.

1275
02:22:50,146 --> 02:22:52,690
Harry, do you know why...

1276
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:56,944
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1277
02:22:57,153 --> 02:23:01,782
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1278
02:23:02,325 --> 02:23:05,536
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1279
02:23:05,703 --> 02:23:09,540
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1280
02:23:09,707 --> 02:23:14,670
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1281
02:23:15,504 --> 02:23:19,216
Love, Harry. Love.

1282
02:23:27,308 --> 02:23:31,395
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1283
02:23:31,646 --> 02:23:36,317
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1284
02:23:36,567 --> 02:23:39,862
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1285
02:23:40,071 --> 02:23:43,407
But I think I could be safe...

1286
02:23:43,658 --> 02:23:46,035
...with a nice toffee.

1287
02:23:48,746 --> 02:23:51,666
Hm, alas!

1288
02:23:52,375 --> 02:23:54,502
Earwax.

1289
02:24:09,725 --> 02:24:12,895
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1290
02:24:14,021 --> 02:24:16,732
All right. Hermione?

1291
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:19,235
Never better.

1292
02:24:35,042 --> 02:24:37,461
Another year gone.

1293
02:24:38,254 --> 02:24:42,800
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1294
02:24:42,967 --> 02:24:45,636
And the points stand thus:

1295
02:24:45,803 --> 02:24:51,642
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1296
02:24:53,602 --> 02:24:59,275
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1297
02:25:04,572 --> 02:25:06,323
In second place...

1298
02:25:06,574 --> 02:25:11,328
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1299
02:25:17,001 --> 02:25:18,753
And in first place...

1300
02:25:19,086 --> 02:25:24,508
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1301
02:25:30,097 --> 02:25:32,308
Nice one, mate.

1302
02:25:36,145 --> 02:25:40,232
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1303
02:25:40,483 --> 02:25:44,779
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1304
02:25:44,987 --> 02:25:49,950
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1305
02:25:50,534 --> 02:25:56,040
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1306
02:25:56,290 --> 02:25:59,043
...while others were in grave peril...

1307
02:25:59,794 --> 02:26:02,046
...50 points.

1308
02:26:02,963 --> 02:26:04,256
Good job.

1309
02:26:11,972 --> 02:26:18,020
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1310
02:26:18,521 --> 02:26:23,776
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1311
02:26:28,405 --> 02:26:30,407
And third...

1312
02:26:30,991 --> 02:26:33,869
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1313
02:26:34,078 --> 02:26:38,374
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1314
02:26:38,916 --> 02:26:43,838
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1315
02:26:52,096 --> 02:26:54,056
We're tied with Slytherin!

1316
02:26:54,265 --> 02:27:00,271
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1317
02:27:00,437 --> 02:27:04,358
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1318
02:27:04,567 --> 02:27:07,528
I award 10 points...

1319
02:27:07,736 --> 02:27:10,948
...to Neville Longbottom.

1320
02:27:24,295 --> 02:27:27,715
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1321
02:27:27,923 --> 02:27:32,469
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1322
02:27:37,474 --> 02:27:40,895
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1323
02:27:42,980 --> 02:27:45,274
Yes!

1324
02:28:00,581 --> 02:28:02,166
We won!

1325
02:28:18,933 --> 02:28:22,269
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1326
02:28:22,478 --> 02:28:26,774
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1327
02:28:32,196 --> 02:28:35,491
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1328
02:28:41,705 --> 02:28:45,501
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1329
02:28:48,712 --> 02:28:50,547
This is for you.

1330
02:29:07,314 --> 02:29:09,441
Thanks, Hagrid.

1331
02:29:15,239 --> 02:29:19,702
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1332
02:29:20,077 --> 02:29:24,581
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1333
02:29:24,832 --> 02:29:27,501
...you could always threaten him...

1334
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:30,587
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1335
02:29:30,754 --> 02:29:35,884
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1336
02:29:36,343 --> 02:29:40,681
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1337
02:29:46,186 --> 02:29:49,273
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1338
02:29:49,523 --> 02:29:51,608
I'm not going home.

1339
02:29:51,775 --> 02:29:53,736
Not really.
