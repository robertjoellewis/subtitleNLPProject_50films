When we die, our bodies

one day, you will be king.

177

Oh, goody!

My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

184

Hey, Uncle Scar.

188
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,843
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

189
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,178
A monkey's uncle.

- You have no idea.

00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,352
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

192
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,520
Everything.

193
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,190
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

194
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,694
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

195
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,779
And he's absolutely right.

196
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,197
It's far too dangerous.

197
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,700
Only the bravest lions go there.

198
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,453
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

199
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,955
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

200
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,123
Why not?

201
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:34,627
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

202
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,547
Yeah, right!
I'm your only nephew.

203
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,133
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

204
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,471
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

205
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,140
An elephant what? Whoa!

206

Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

208

you being so clever and all.

209
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,151
Just do me one favour.

210
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,822
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

211

No problem.

212

You run along now and have fun.

215
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,082

It's a tradition going back generations.

262

Well, he's the future king.

You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

282

- No one sayin', "Do this"
- Now, when I said that...

No, Scar.

Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.

I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?

Tell me. I mean, anything.

Run.
