1
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,572
<i>I knew Harvey Dent.</i>

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,907
<i>I was his friend.</i>

3
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,243
And it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did.

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,587
I believed in Harvey Dent.

5
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,442
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

6
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,648
He wasn't alone.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,860
Uh, you don't get to bring friends.
They are not my friends.

8
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,025
Don't worry, no charge for them.

9
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,996
And why would I want them?
They were trying to grab your prize.

10
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,830
They work for the mercenary.

11
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,866
The masked man.

12
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,911
Bane?
Aye.

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,668
Get them on board. I'll call it in.

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,599
The flight plan I just filed
with the agency...

15
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,979
lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,356
but only one of you!

17
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,655
First one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft!

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,245
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

19
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,381
He didn't fly so good!

20
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,541
Who wants to try next?

21
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,128
Tell me about Bane!

22
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,796
Why does he wear the mask?

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,968
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

24
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,809
Well, perhaps he's wondering
why someone would shoot a man...

25
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,100
before throwing him out of a plane.

26
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,780
At least you can talk.

27
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,065
Who are you?

28
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,701
It doesn't matter who we are.

29
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,324
What matters is our plan.

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,085
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

31
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,667
If I pull that off, will you die?

32
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,007
It would be extremely painful.

33
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,341
You're a big guy.

34
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,721
For you.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,887
Was getting caught part of your plan?

36
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,555
Of course.

37
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,022
Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours.

38
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,692
We had to find out what he told you...
Nothing. I said nothing.

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,630
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!

40
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,493
Sir?

41
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,217
Now what's the next
step of your master plan?

42
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,806
Crashing this plane...

43
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,639
with no survivors.

44
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,042
Mayday, Mayday!

45
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,466
Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out!

46
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,804
No!

47
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,102
No, no, no! No!

48
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,575
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.

49
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,203
Have we started the fire?

50
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,949
Yes, the fire rises.

51
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,470
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.

52
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,843
That comes later.

53
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,245
<i>Harvey Dent Day
may not be our oldest public holiday...</i>

54
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,460
<i>but we're here tonight
because it's one of the most important.</i>

55
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,753
<i>Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime...</i>

56
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,049
had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.

57
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,388
This city has seen a historic turnaround.

58
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,232
No city is without
crime, but this city is

59
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:11,895
without organized crime
because the Dent Act...

60
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,277
gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob.

61
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,110
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act...

62
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,276
and to them I say, "Not on my watch."

63
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,530
I want to thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

64
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,749
I'm told Mr. Wayne
couldn't be here tonight.

65
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,826
I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

66
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,745
And now I'm gonna give way
to an important voice...

67
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,381
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

68
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,257
No one has. Not in years.

69
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,296
<i>People put their faith
in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.</i>

70
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,012
A thug who showed his true nature...

71
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,643
when he betrayed the trust
of this great man...

72
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,312
and murdered him in cold blood.

73
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,391
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

74
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,559
Shrimp balls?
Thank you.

75
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,196
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.

76
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,823
Commissioner Gordon.

77
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,625
The truth?

78
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,840
I have...

79
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,752
written a speech...

80
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,760
telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

81
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,892
Maybe the time isn't right.

82
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,277
Maybe right now...

83
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,064
all you need to know
is that there are...

84
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:47,032
1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

85
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,120
These are violent criminals, essential cogs
in the organized-crime machine.

86
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,204
Maybe, for now, all I should say
about the death of Harvey Dent is this:

87
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,716
It has not been for nothing.

88
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,714
<i>You see the guy who owns the house?</i>
<i>No. I heard...</i>

89
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,851
...he never leaves the east wing.
I heard he had an accident.

90
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,764
Yeah, that he's disfigured. He
has to wear a... ALFRED: Mr. Till?

91
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,650
Why are your people
using the main staircase?

92
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,148
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

93
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,022
Uh, she's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

94
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,406
The east drawing room.

95
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,571
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

96
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,994
<i>I'm sorry, Miss Tate.
I tried, but he won't see you.</i>

97
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,166
And you mustn't take it personally.

98
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,342
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up
in there with 8-inch nails...

99
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,173
peeing into Mason jars.

100
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,713
It's very good of you
to let me on the grounds.

101
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,403
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man...

102
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,283
who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project?

103
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,694
He can't get your money back. I can.

104
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,866
I could try explaining that
a save-the-world project, vain or not...

105
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,455
is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

106
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,792
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys...

107
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,920
so why waste my time indeed?

108
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,960
<i>Second shift reports in?</i>

109
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,221
You should spend more time
with the mayor.

110
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,256
Well, that's your department.

111
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,055
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

112
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,517
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,
no matter what the numbers.

113
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,607
Must be popular with his wife.

114
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,559
Not really. She took
the kids to Cleveland.

115
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,945
He'll have plenty of time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

116
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,651
Really?
Mm-hm.

117
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,694
But he's a hero.
A war hero. This is peacetime.

118
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,227
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

119
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,360
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

120
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:37,205
Although you don't have the long nails
or, heh, the facial scars, sir.

121
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,200
Is that what they say about me?

122
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,454
It's just that no one ever sees you.

123
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,833
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother.

124
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,094
It can't be the same one...

125
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,760
because her pearls are in this safe...

126
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,098
the manufacturer clearly explained...

127
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,606
is uncrackable.

128
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,613
Oops.

129
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,991
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

130
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,161
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

131
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,283
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman
any more than I would beat up a cripple.

132
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,170
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

133
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,507
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

134
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,062
Can I have a ride?

135
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,733
You read my mind.

136
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,069
Let's go.

137
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,864
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

138
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,653
She's very persistent.

139
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,164
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.

140
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,495
I wasn't.
What are you doing?

141
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,958
Examining print dust.
We've been robbed.

142
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,090
And this is your idea
of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it?

143
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,421
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

144
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,880
She?
One of the maids.

145
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,671
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this side of the house.

146
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,307
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

147
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,394
Why were you dusting for prints?
I wasn't.

148
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,730
She was.

149
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,066
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife
has been calling in.

150
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,108
The congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.

151
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,447
That's a job for the police?

152
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,453
When you and Dent cleaned the streets,
you cleaned them good.

153
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,412
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down, uh,
overdue library books.

154
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,336
And yet here you are,
like we're still at war.

155
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,544
What's your name, son?
Blake, sir.

156
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,508
You have something you want to ask me?

157
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,101
It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

158
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,227
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

159
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,477
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...

160
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,394
breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

161
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,196
I'm not hearing a question, son.

162
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,323
Don't you want to know who he was?

163
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,614
I know exactly who he was.

164
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,577
He was the Batman.

165
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,536
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.

166
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,846
Master Wayne?

167
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,599
Master Wayne?

168
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,833
You haven't been down here in a long time.

169
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,549
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

170
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,513
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...

171
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,142
she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.

172
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,426
She's good.

173
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,143
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.

174
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,933
We do. I cross-referenced the address
she went back to...

175
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,695
with police data
on high-end B-and-E's, and, um...

176
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,939
Selina Kyle.

177
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,953
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.

178
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,116
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

179
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,035
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

180
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,420
She won't. She likes them too much.

181
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,377
And they weren't what she was after.

182
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,633
What was she after?
My fingerprints.

183
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,795
It was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.

184
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,555
It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.

185
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,558
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

186
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,015
You're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

187
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,402
At this point, I'd set you
up with a chimpanzee,

188
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:14,649
if it brought you
back to the world.

189
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,060
There's nothing out there for me.

190
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,812
And that's the problem.

191
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,527
You hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didn't move on.

192
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,987
You never went to find a life.
To find someone.

193
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,527
Alfred...

194
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,325
I did find someone.

195
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,910
I know, and you lost them.

196
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,040
But that's all part of living, sir.

197
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,330
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

198
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,005
Remember when you left Gotham?

199
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,168
Before all this, before Batman?

200
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,965
You were gone seven year.

201
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,724
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

202
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,512
Every year, I took a holiday.
I went to Florence.

203
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,930
<i>There's this café
on the banks of the Arno.</i>

204
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,350
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

205
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,403
I had this fantasy...

206
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,195
that I would look across the tables...

207
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,327
<i>and I'd see you there, with a wife.</i>

208
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,326
<i>Maybe a couple of kids.</i>

209
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,286
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

210
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,299
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

211
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,801
That you were happy.

212
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,392
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

213
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,057
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.

214
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,101
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

215
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,448
I still do.

216
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,538
<i>They wash up here
a couple of times a month.</i>

217
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,165
<i>More when it gets colder.</i>

218
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,291
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.

219
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,082
We pulled him from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch him.

220
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,085
What?
Name's Jimmy.

221
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,674
He's from St. Swithin's.

222
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,221
It's the boys' home
where I coach some ball.

223
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,729
<i>Jimmy hadn't been around for months.</i>

224
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,390
No? Why?
Blake, you know why.

225
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,403
He aged out. We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 16.

226
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,655
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.

227
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,907
Not for the past couple of years.

228
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,911
He has a brother here, doesn't he?
Mark. I'll tell him.

229
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,073
I'd like to, if that's all right.

230
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,292
You know what he was doing
in the tunnels?

231
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,297
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels
when they age out.

232
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,676
Say you can live down there.

233
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,882
Say there's work down there.

234
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,547
Work?

235
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,512
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?

236
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,302
More than you can find up here, I guess.

237
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,430
So you know about him?

238
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,848
Of course.

239
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,355
Do you think he's coming back?

240
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,858
I don't know.

241
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,249
You brought a date?

242
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,631
I like having someone around
to open doors for me.

243
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,760
Right hand. No partials.

244
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,142
Very nice.
Mm-hm.

245
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,015
Not so fast, handsome.

246
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,555
You got something for me?

247
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,641
Ah, yes.

248
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,321
I don't know what you're planning to do
with Mr. Wayne's prints...

249
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,286
but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

250
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,168
You don't count so good, huh?

251
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,578
I count fine.

252
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,168
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

253
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,672
Okay.

254
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,471
My friend's outside. Just hit "send."

255
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,571
This place is a little dead.

256
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,984
It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

257
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,694
Is everything okay?

258
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,863
Great. Catch you later.

259
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,877
Hmm.

260
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,880
It would have been a lot easier...

261
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,253
to just give me what we agreed.

262
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,836
We can't have loose ends.

263
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,840
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

264
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,508
No.

265
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,551
But my friend over there?

266
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,892
Every cop in the city's missing him.

267
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,397
That's cute.

268
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,275
But they're not gonna be looking
in a place like this.

269
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,354
I don't know.
You did just use his cell phone.

270
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,949
Go!
Go!

271
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,929
Police! Get down now!

272
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,346
Help me! Help me!

273
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,561
Help me, please! Please help me!

274
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,369
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

275
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,073
Call me?

276
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,329
You okay, miss?
He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

277
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,717
I got the congressman.

278
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,952
Clear!

279
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,048
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!

280
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,546
You three, down with me.

281
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,134
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

282
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,155
What, they went down there?

283
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,769
We're gonna go down there, right?
That was a gas explosion, kid.

284
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,186
Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.
No one goes in till we know what's there.

285
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,195
We know, sir. The police commissioner.

286
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,197
Someone get this hothead out of here?

287
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,859
And where's that DWP guy?

288
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,452
Why are you here?

289
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,785
Answer him.

290
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,372
I was asking you.

291
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,290
It's the police commissioner.

292
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,551
And you brought him down here?

293
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,804
We didn't know what to do.
You panicked.

294
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,308
And your weakness has cost the lives
of three others.

295
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,592
No, he's alone.

296
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,018
Search him.

297
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,728
Then I will kill you.

298
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,178
He's dead.
So show me his body.

299
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,765
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'd never find him.

300
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,981
Follow him!
Follow him?

301
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,541
You okay? You okay?

302
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,626
Hey, hey, you awake?

303
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,880
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

304
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,516
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.

305
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,472
Even from a police officer.

306
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,310
And if I go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

307
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,691
That still count as unscheduled?

308
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,901
What can I do for you, officer?

309
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,325
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

310
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,700
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.

311
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,207
When I pulled him out, he was babbling
about an underground army.

312
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,209
A masked man called Bane.

313
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,379
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

314
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,633
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

315
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,801
He needs you.

316
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,675
He needs the Batman.

317
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,222
If Commissioner Gordon thinks...
Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

318
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,978
But we've met before.

319
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:24,227
It was a long time ago. I was a kid.
Uh, St. Swithin's.

320
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,614
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

321
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,695
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

322
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,496
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

323
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
and I remember that one just fine.

324
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,253
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

325
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
To be angry...

326
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,970
in your bones.

327
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,679
I mean, they understand.

328
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,681
Foster parents.

329
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,846
Everybody understands...

330
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,640
for a while.

331
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,111
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

332
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,778
Move on.

333
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,322
So after a while,
they stop understanding.

334
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,358
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

335
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,534
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

336
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,582
Practice smiling in a mirror.

337
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,911
It's like putting on a mask.

338
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,712
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

339
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,717
Pretty girl on your arm.

340
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,591
We were so excited.

341
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,473
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

342
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,679
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

343
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,644
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

344
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,519
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

345
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,777
I'd seen that look on your face before.

346
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,943
It's the same one I taught myself.

347
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,782
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

348
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,705
but I'm still a
believer in the Batman...

349
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,207
even if you're not.

350
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,841
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

351
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
Because the money stopped.

352
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:20,142
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.

353
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,387
Some of those details
might need your help.

354
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,523
You check that name? Bane?

355
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,356
He's a mercenary.
No other known names.

356
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,987
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

357
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,651
that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

358
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,158
Now Daggett's brought them here.
Or so it seems.

359
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,367
I'll keep digging.
Yeah.

360
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:51,799
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

361
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:57,054
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

362
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,926
There have to be some.

363
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,434
Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
I'll get him on the phone.

364
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,597
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

365
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,640
Yes. One or two.

366
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
I need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.

367
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,729
Which hospital?
Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

368
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,907
I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
That's good.

369
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,572
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

370
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,084
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

371
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,620
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...

372
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,460
the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue...

373
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,296
and the general scarred-over quality
of your body...

374
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,383
I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
Right.

375
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,355
We were in this together...

376
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,029
then you were gone.

377
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,320
The Batman wasn't needed any more.

378
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,615
We won.
Based on a lie.

379
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:13,127
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

380
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,801
The Batman has to come back.

381
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,428
What if he doesn't exist any more?

382
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,057
He must.

383
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,614
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

384
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,652
You f... You took my wallet!
No, I...

385
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,579
Get out.
She took my... Ah!

386
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,331
Now.
Creep!

387
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,414
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

388
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,328
Probably the watch.

389
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,640
Who's that?

390
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,931
A stiff can barely
climb out of his sports car.

391
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,225
No, that's Bruce Wayne!
Mr. Wayne, over here!

392
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,649
I'm not sure if my assistant...
Right through here.

393
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,317
Thank you so much.

394
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,372
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

395
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,287
Miss Tate, isn't it?

396
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,337
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

397
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,170
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

398
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,682
It's about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on.

399
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,598
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

400
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,433
Oh.

401
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,358
And the proceeds will
go where they should,

402
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:57,935
because I paid for the
big fat spread myself.

403
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,728
That's very generous of you.

404
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,824
You have to invest if you want to restore
balance to the world.

405
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,734
Take our clean-energy project.

406
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,904
Sometimes the investment
doesn't pay off.

407
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,371
I'm sorry.
You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

408
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,664
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

409
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,668
And isn't so wounded when it fails...

410
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,711
that he goes into hiding.

411
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,265
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

412
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,975
Mind if I cut in?

413
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,898
Thank you.

414
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,942
You don't seem happy to see me.
You were supposed to be a shut-in.

415
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,981
I felt like some fresh air.

416
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,902
Why didn't you call the police?

417
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,909
I have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.

418
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:55,372
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.

419
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,503
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

420
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,381
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

421
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
Who's your date?
His wife's in Ibiza.

422
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,426
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.

423
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,636
It's pronounced "Ibiza."

424
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,891
You wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook, not a social climber.

425
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,182
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

426
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,193
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

427
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,073
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

428
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,911
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here
from your walk-up in Old Town.

429
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,912
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

430
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,371
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement...

431
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,086
or you're in deep with the wrong people.

432
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:44,383
You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

433
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,887
Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
I started out doing what I had to.

434
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,425
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.

435
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,844
Start fresh.

436
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,230
Ugh. There's no fresh
start in today's world.

437
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,437
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

438
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.

439
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,981
Is that how you justify stealing?

440
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,742
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

441
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,198
I don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.

442
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,408
Robin Hood?

443
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,701
I think I'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room. Than you.

444
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,753
You think maybe you're assuming
a little too much?

445
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,924
Maybe you're being
unrealistic about what's

446
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:25,961
really in your pants
other than your wallet.

447
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,171
Ouch.

448
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,764
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

449
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,602
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, because when it hits...

450
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:41,641
you're all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large...

451
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,901
and leave so little for the rest of us.

452
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,691
You sound like
you're looking forward to it.

453
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,701
I'm adaptable.

454
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,114
Those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe.

455
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,083
But I still can't let you keep them.

456
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,922
You... You scared her off!

457
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,384
Not likely.

458
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,885
Must have lost my ticket.

459
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,416
Your wife said you
were taking a cab home.

460
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,804
My wife?

461
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,275
Just you, sir?

462
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,360
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

463
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,160
Takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things.

464
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,578
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

465
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,749
What brings you out of cryo-sleep,
Mr. Wayne?

466
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,667
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

467
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,337
Even if you have lost most of my money.

468
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,005
Actually, you did that.

469
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,890
If you funnel your entire R and D budget...

470
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,973
into a fusion project
that you then mothball...

471
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,480
your company is unlikely to thrive.

472
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,685
What are my options?

473
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,226
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine...

474
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,944
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

475
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,067
Well, then sit tight.

476
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,948
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...

477
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,112
while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.

478
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,906
She has supported the project
all the way.

479
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,496
She's smart. And quite lovely.

480
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,542
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

481
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,041
Show her the machine.

482
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,255
I'll think it over.

483
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,761
Anything else?

484
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,172
Nope. Why?

485
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,388
These conversations used to end
with an unusual request.

486
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,557
I retired.

487
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,941
Mm-hm. Well, let me show you
some stuff anyway.

488
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,563
Just for old times' sake.

489
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,074
I figured you'd have
shut this place down.

490
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,910
Oh, it was always shut down, officially.

491
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,164
All this new stuff.

492
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:08,955
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

493
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,794
For years, I've been shuttering
and consolidating...

494
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,334
all the different prototypes
under one roof.

495
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,219
My roof.
Why?

496
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,177
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

497
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,431
Oh, now you're just showing off.

498
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:30,226
Defense Department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification.

499
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,322
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.

500
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,274
What's it called?

501
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:42,120
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

502
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,657
I just took to calling it the Bat.

503
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,202
And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

504
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,965
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

505
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,338
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

506
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,878
Better mind?

507
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,427
Well, I was trying to be modest.

508
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,721
A less busy mind.

509
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,430
Yours.

510
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,446
Is it really painful?
You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

511
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,322
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

512
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,864
Not bad.

513
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,329
Not bad at all.

514
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,916
If you're seriously considering
going back out there...

515
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,210
you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

516
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,423
I'm all ears.

517
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,428
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

518
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,805
A pit where men are thrown
to suffer and die.

519
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,734
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.

520
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:58,105
Sometimes the pit sends something back.

521
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,399
Bane.
Bane.

522
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,739
Born and raised in hell on earth.

523
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,827
Born in a prison?
No one knows why, or how he escaped.

524
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,583
But they do know that once he did...

525
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,918
he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

526
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?

527
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,421
And then he was excommunicated.

528
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,599
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

529
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,011
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

530
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,933
That was then.

531
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,186
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on...

532
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,943
but that doesn't make you
what you were.

533
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,732
If this man is everything that you
say he is, then the city needs me.

534
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,868
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

535
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,157
Your resources. Your knowledge.

536
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,415
It doesn't need your body, or your life.

537
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,371
That time's past.

538
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,912
You're afraid that if I go back out there,
I'll fail.

539
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,331
No.

540
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,801
I'm afraid that you want to.

541
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,481
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

542
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:23,486
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

543
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,945
On what basis?

544
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,655
I flipped a coin.

545
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,705
It says rye... I said no rye, man.

546
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,085
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

547
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,052
Come on. Let's go scalping.

548
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,526
Come on.

549
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,466
Everybody down, now!

550
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,495
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

551
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,032
Really? Then why are you people here?

552
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,260
Everybody, stay back!
Go down to the end of the block!

553
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,394
We have an emergency situation!

554
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,274
You gotta get in there!

555
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,026
This is a hostage situation.

556
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,610
No, this is a robbery. They have
direct access to the online trading desk.

557
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,570
I'm not risking my men for your money.

558
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,164
We have to ask you to move.
We have a situation.

559
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,370
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

560
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,627
Really? Mine's in my mattress.

561
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,026
<i>You don't put these guys
down, that stuffing in</i>

562
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:45,291
<i>your mattress might be
worth a whole lot less.</i>

563
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,709
Cut the fiber cable
and take out that cell tower.

564
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,378
Thank you.
That'll slow them down.

565
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,092
Move back!

566
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,929
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!

567
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,018
They cut the fiber.

568
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,270
Cell's working.

569
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,772
For now.

570
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,262
Get all these barriers up.
All of them up. No

571
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:11,111
one gets in or out of
any of these streets.

572
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,901
Where am I supposed to move it?

573
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,364
Back it up.

574
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,167
All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?

575
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,130
How much longer
does the program need?

576
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,883
Eight minutes.

577
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,715
Time to go mobile.

578
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,225
Everybody, up!

579
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,847
You two, move!

580
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,980
Thank you.

581
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,403
Steady.

582
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,489
Steady.

583
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,460
I've got something.

584
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,085
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.

585
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,503
Hold your fire!

586
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,973
Go, go!

587
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,363
Please! Just let me go!

588
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,320
Hey, please! Hey!

589
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,745
Shoot the tires.

590
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,376
There's no shot.

591
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,915
Now back off.
Back off, they've got hostages.

592
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,834
<i>P.D. are pursuing
the four suspects through downtown...</i>

593
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,048
<i>in response to a hostage situation.</i>

594
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,223
What's going on with the lights?

595
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,610
It can't be.

596
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,153
What the hell was that?

597
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,156
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.

598
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,656
Please! Help, help, help!

599
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,554
Sorry.

600
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,475
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself. Get in!

601
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,766
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.

602
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,197
Call everyone in.
Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too.

603
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,082
Pull them in now. I'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.

604
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,461
What's that?
I'm gonna take down the Batman.

605
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,668
<i>Are confirming
four suspects are carrying two hostages...</i>

606
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,879
<i>kidnapped from
the Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

607
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:19,342
<i>Reports from the eyewitnesses...
Scott, dead center of your screen.</i>

608
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,926
<i>What do you see?</i>
<i>I see Batman.</i>

609
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,763
<i>Hard to believe, but the suspects
are now being pursued...</i>

610
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,893
<i>by what appears to be the Batman.</i>

611
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,145
Well, what do you know?

612
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,277
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

613
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,658
Please! Just let me go! Please!

614
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,796
<i>One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?</i>

615
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,881
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

616
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,598
He's getting away.
Who do you wanna catch?

617
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,306
Some robber, or the son of a bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

618
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,017
<i>The entire upper west hill...</i>

619
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,231
<i>Central Heights
and East Park Side areas.</i>

620
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,318
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.

621
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,741
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

622
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,542
Please! Just let me go!

623
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,082
Please!

624
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,741
<i>We lost him.</i>

625
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,664
How could you lose him?

626
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,419
<i>He's got a lot of firepower.</i>

627
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,670
What, and you don't?

628
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,211
<i>He's heading back downtown.</i>

629
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,425
<i>Then he's as dumb as he dresses.</i>

630
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,640
Close it off, gentlemen.

631
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,459
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

632
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,759
You might have
the wrong animal there, sir.

633
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,317
You sure it was him?

634
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,577
<i>Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.</i>

635
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,366
What about the men they arrested?

636
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:21,629
He said, and I quote,
"They would die before talking."

637
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,128
Where does he find these guys?

638
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,461
Open the champagne.

639
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,007
And can we get some girls in here?

640
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,595
Careful what you wish for.

641
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,946
Cat got your tongue?

642
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,321
You dumb bitch.

643
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,574
Nobody ever accused me
of being dumb.

644
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,657
You're dumb for coming here tonight.

645
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,743
I want what you owe me.

646
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,497
Want doesn't get.

647
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:05,043
Nice outfit.
Those heels make it tough to walk?

648
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,422
I don't know.
Aah!

649
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,418
Do they?

650
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,345
So where is it?
Where's what?

651
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,889
The program. The "clean slate."

652
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,351
The ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record.

653
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,640
Hold it right there!

654
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,197
Where is it?

655
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,328
The clean slate?

656
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,115
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth...

657
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:43,457
in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

658
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,793
Sound a little too good to be true?
You're lying!

659
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,549
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.

660
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,676
That's why I bought them.

661
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,463
But they had nothing.

662
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,598
It was a gangland myth.

663
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,107
Stay back!

664
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,108
I'm not bluffing!

665
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,402
They know.

666
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,241
They just don't care.

667
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,884
You've gotta be kidding me.

668
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,596
No guns. No killing.
Where's the fun in that?

669
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,535
My mother warned me about
getting into cars with strange men.

670
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,744
This isn't a car.

671
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,466
See you around.

672
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,585
You're welcome.

673
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,337
I had it under control.

674
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,847
Those weren't street thugs.

675
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,099
They were trained killers.

676
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,930
I saved your life.

677
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,890
In return, I need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

678
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,605
Wayne wasn't kidding about
a powerful friend.

679
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,645
I sold his prints to Daggett...

680
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,074
for something that doesn't even exist.

681
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,207
I doubt many people
get the better of you.

682
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,079
Hey, when a
girl's desperate...

683
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,581
What's he gonna do with them?
I don't know...

684
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,118
but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

685
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,841
Miss Kyle?

686
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,971
So that's what that feels like.

687
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:04,825
I see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back.

688
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,955
I retrieved this.

689
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,583
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

690
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,166
They don't have the tools to analyze it.
They would if you gave them to them.

691
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,831
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

692
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,343
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.

693
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,629
Alfred, enough.
The police weren't getting it done.

694
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,174
Perhaps they might have if you
hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

695
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,228
You thought I
didn't have it in me.

696
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:29,140
You led a bloated police
force on a chase...

697
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,897
with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

698
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,899
What about when you come up
against him? What then?

699
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,447
I'll fight harder.
I always have.

700
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,859
Look. His speed, his
ferocity, his training.

701
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,696
I see the power of belief.

702
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,782
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

703
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,412
You said he was excommunicated.

704
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,448
By Ra's Al Ghul.

705
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,582
Who leads them now?

706
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,336
Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows
and I beat him.

707
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,247
Bane is a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.

708
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:01,006
Trades of some kind. Coded.

709
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,634
And my fingerprint,
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

710
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,888
Get this to Fox.

711
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:10,394
He can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing.

712
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,731
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.

713
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,944
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones,
but I won't bury you.

714
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,486
I've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.

715
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:32,625
You'll leave me?
You see only one end to your journey.

716
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,672
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

717
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,459
You're not Batman any more.
You have to find another way.

718
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,596
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.

719
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,475
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

720
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:53,513
That was my life beyond the cave.
I can't just move on.

721
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,815
She... She didn't. She couldn't.

722
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,018
What if she had?

723
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,652
She... I can't change that.

724
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,815
What if before she died
she wrote a letter...

725
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:07,451
saying she chose
Harvey Dent over you?

726
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,165
And what if...

727
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,084
to spare you pain...

728
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,788
I burnt that letter?

729
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,843
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?

730
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,468
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

731
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:34,012
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

732
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,765
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

733
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,650
You expect to destroy my world...

734
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,398
and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

735
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,237
No, no, no.

736
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,577
I know what this means.

737
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,828
What does it mean?

738
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,410
It means your hatred.

739
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,335
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for...

740
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,919
since I first heard his cries echo...

741
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,676
through this house.

742
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:10,256
But it might also mean saving your life.

743
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,971
And that is more important.

744
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,228
Goodbye, Alfred.

745
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,210
Alfred?

746
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,010
Answering your own door?
Yeah.

747
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,717
Page three.

748
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,260
Seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange...

749
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,723
verified by thumbprint.

750
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,560
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

751
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:05,774
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...

752
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,361
and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

753
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:13,369
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

754
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,497
Applied Sciences is all looked up
and off the books.

755
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,875
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

756
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,535
Miranda Tate.

757
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,836
Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.

758
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,501
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

759
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,385
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

760
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,556
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

761
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,731
Please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times.

762
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,109
This is it, isn't it?

763
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,283
The reactor is beneath the river...

764
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:57,572
so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

765
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,204
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

766
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,664
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

767
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,466
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

768
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,301
No fossil fuels.

769
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,057
Free clean energy for an entire city.

770
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,766
<i>Three years ago,
a Russian scientist published a paper...</i>

771
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,226
<i>on weaponized fusion reactions.</i>

772
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,316
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

773
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,189
I think this machine works.

774
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:38,988
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

775
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,249
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...

776
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,206
died in a plane crash six months ago?

777
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,872
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

778
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:55,217
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

779
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,926
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

780
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,636
and this reactor.

781
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,179
To do what with it?

782
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:05,848
Nothing.

783
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,559
Until we can guarantee its safety.

784
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,942
And if we can't?

785
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,774
Decommission it. Flood it.

786
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,737
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

787
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,526
If the world's not ready, yes.

788
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:21,993
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

789
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,741
I'm trusting you.

790
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,875
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

791
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,962
I could have flooded this chamber
at any time.

792
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,168
I'm choosing to trust you.

793
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,257
Please.

794
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,603
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.

795
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,935
I'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here...

796
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,443
which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

797
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,854
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

798
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,772
And he himself has run it.

799
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,305
Into the ground, sir!
Does anybody disagree?

800
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:00,695
Check the share
price this morning.

801
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,115
Crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

802
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,580
it's cost us all a lot of money.

803
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,585
And he has to go.

804
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,455
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

805
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,553
Now, back to business.

806
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,478
Mr. Wayne, over here!
How's it feel to be one of the people?

807
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:30,686
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car! I
didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

808
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,152
Looks like you need a ride, huh?

809
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,530
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

810
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,989
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?

811
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,324
She been meeting with him?
Sleeping with him?

812
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,456
Not that we know of.
You don't know much of anything, do you?

813
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,537
Where's Bane?
We told him it was urgent.

814
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,328
Where is that masked...?
Speak of the devil...

815
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,747
and he shall appear.

816
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,382
What the hell is going on?

817
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,379
The plan is proceeding as expected.
Oh, really?

818
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,344
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

819
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:08,182
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

820
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:13,476
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

821
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,568
How exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne's?

822
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,527
Leave us.
No. You stay here.

823
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,286
I'm in charge.

824
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,449
Do you feel in charge?

825
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,247
I've paid you a small fortune.

826
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,383
And this gives you power over me?

827
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,380
What is this?

828
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,515
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

829
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,008
till now.

830
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,635
What are you?

831
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,645
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

832
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,683
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

833
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,854
You're pure evil.

834
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,318
I'm necessary evil.

835
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,404
No. No, no, no!

836
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,456
When you started, why the mask?

837
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,336
To protect the people closest to me.
But you were a loner, right?

838
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,580
You didn't have any family?
There are always people you care about.

839
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,671
You just don't realize how much
until they're gone.

840
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,963
The idea was to be a symbol.

841
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,258
Batman could be anybody.

842
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,346
That was the point.

843
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,937
Well, it was damn good to see him back.
Not everybody agrees.

844
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:37,359
They'll figure that out in the end.
You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

845
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,112
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight.

846
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,365
I could use some help, actually.

847
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,234
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

848
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,456
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

849
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,787
That's the way this works!
I don't think so!

850
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,203
That is the way...
He's not a mark.

851
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,043
And he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.

852
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:03,840
Yeah, it's not much.
But it's more than you've got right now.

853
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,425
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

854
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,182
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us, huh?

855
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,311
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

856
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,098
And how would he do that?
By giving you what you want.

857
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,938
It doesn't exist.
He says it does.

858
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,360
He wants to meet tonight.

859
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,566
Why?

860
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,653
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.

861
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,204
Tell him I'll think about it.
Okay.

862
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,239
I like your place.

863
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,825
Mr. Wayne?

864
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,706
I'm sorry they took all your money.

865
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,086
No, you're not.

866
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:47,008
Can we help you, officer?
Uh, yeah.

867
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,720
John Daggett's body was just found
in a Dumpster about an hour ago.

868
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,850
Thought you might want to know.
Why?

869
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,062
His name's all over
these permits I just

870
01:06:55,075 --> 01:06:57,139
pulled to, uh, map the
tunnels under Gotham.

871
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:01,185
That's MTA maintenance, uh,
sewer construction, couple of other things.

872
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,355
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

873
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,400
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

874
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,738
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

875
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,246
Well, get more men. Work a grid.
I want him found.

876
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,748
Yeah, the, uh, masked man. We're on it.

877
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,660
Lose the uniform,
you're working for me now.

878
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,249
We could use some hotter heads
around here.

879
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,542
Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
You're a detective now, son.

880
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,837
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence any more.

881
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,561
Nobody's answering.

882
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,105
No.

883
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,941
I'm on my own now.

884
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,192
Do you have keys?

885
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,570
Never needed them.

886
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,991
Hope you didn't like me for my money.

887
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,335
Suffering builds character.

888
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,924
I'll take care of your
parents' legacy, Bruce.

889
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,431
Who's this?

890
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,607
Where's Alfred?

891
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,769
He left...

892
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,405
taking everything.

893
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,756
What's that?

894
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,846
My power's been shut off.

895
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,816
You're good at that.

896
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,857
When I was a child,
we had almost nothing.

897
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:13,818
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

898
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,622
I assumed your family was wealthy.

899
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,907
Not always.

900
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,455
Not when I was young.

901
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,961
An old mistake.

902
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,957
I've made a few myself.

903
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,835
More than a few.

904
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,589
We could leave.

905
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,136
Tonight.

906
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,057
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.

907
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,644
Someday, perhaps.

908
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,067
Not tonight.

909
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,097
Don't be shy.

910
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,681
Wayne says you can get me
the clean slate.

911
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,763
That depends.
On what?

912
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,557
On what you want it for.

913
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,648
I acquired it to keep it out
of the wrong hands.

914
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,188
Still don't trust me, huh?

915
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,361
How can we change that?

916
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,322
Start by taking me to Bane.

917
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,955
You asked.

918
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,289
From here,
Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

919
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,087
And they're not your average brawlers.

920
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,082
Neither am I.

921
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:00,973
He's behind you.
Who?

922
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,179
Me.

923
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,314
What do you think you're...?

924
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,663
Just a little further.

925
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,419
I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.

926
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:36,004
You made a serious mistake.

927
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:41,511
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

928
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,223
Bane.

929
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,480
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

930
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,067
Mr. Wayne.

931
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,451
Peace has cost you your strength.

932
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,457
Victory has defeated you.

933
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:15,851
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

934
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:18,816
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

935
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,573
Members of the League of Shadows.

936
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,945
And you betrayed us.

937
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,702
"Us"? You were excommunicated...

938
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,414
by a gang of psychopaths.

939
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,796
I am the League of Shadows.

940
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,087
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

941
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,736
You fight like a younger man.

942
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,192
Nothing held back.

943
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,575
Admirable, but mistaken.

944
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,583
Oh, you think darkness is your ally?

945
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,460
But you merely adopted the dark.

946
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,167
I was born in it.

947
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,875
Molded by it.

948
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,137
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

949
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,549
By then, it was nothing to me
but blinding!

950
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,522
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

951
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,114
I will show you where
I have made my home...

952
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,617
whilst preparing to bring justice.

953
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,039
Then I will break you.

954
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,666
Your precious armory.

955
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,678
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.

956
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:20,187
Ah, yes. I was wondering
what would break first.

957
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,735
Your spirit...

958
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,870
or your body.

959
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,993
Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a line
on the congressman's kidnapping.

960
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,261
Excuse me, miss.
Uh, yes?

961
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,597
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

962
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,808
Oh. Do you mind?

963
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,737
I showed your picture to
the congressman. Guess what.

964
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,577
Don't tell me. Still in love?

965
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,288
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

966
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,205
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

967
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,337
Girl's gotta eat.
And you have an appetite.

968
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,948
Why would you run?
You can't hide with a record like this.

969
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,134
Maybe it's not you I'm running from.

970
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,173
Who then? Bane?

971
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,808
What do you know about him?

972
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:22,313
That you should be as afraid of him
as I am.

973
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,348
We can offer you protection.

974
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,690
Okay.

975
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:36,861
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

976
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,240
Did they kill him?

977
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,619
I'm not sure.

978
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,057
Why didn't you just...

979
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,230
kill me?

980
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,863
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

981
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:16,150
Your punishment must be more severe.

982
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,494
Torture?

983
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,911
Yes.

984
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,740
But not of your body.

985
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,878
Of your soul.

986
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,456
Where am I?

987
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:32,045
Home.

988
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,924
Where I learned the truth about despair.

989
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,264
As will you.

990
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,476
There is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth:

991
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,637
Hope.

992
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,932
Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries...

993
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:51,523
has looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom.

994
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:53,946
So easy.

995
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,107
So simple.

996
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:02,664
And like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

997
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,708
many have died trying.

998
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,297
I learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.

999
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,839
So as I terrorize Gotham...

1000
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,972
I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

1001
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,930
I will let them believe
that they can survive...

1002
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:29,065
so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun.

1003
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,021
You can watch me torture an entire city.

1004
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,318
And then when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure...

1005
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,578
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

1006
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,163
We will destroy Gotham.

1007
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,920
And then, when it is done...

1008
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,998
and Gotham is...

1009
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,210
ashes...

1010
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,634
then you have my permission to die.

1011
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,442
You're looking her up in here?

1012
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:25,454
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

1013
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,707
First time she broke out
of women's correctional, she was 16.

1014
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,038
Little closer, baby.

1015
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,294
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

1016
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,380
She's gonna be fine.

1017
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,422
I still don't see the need of a
board meeting for the energy project.

1018
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,178
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1019
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,840
Keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them.

1020
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,893
How good of you to join us.

1021
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,222
Chair. President.

1022
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:55,063
All I need now is one more
ordinary board member.

1023
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,650
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?

1024
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,064
No.

1025
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,732
I will volunteer.

1026
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,822
Where are you taking us?

1027
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,297
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

1028
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,670
What happened?

1029
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,960
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1030
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,050
He let most of them go,
but he took three into the sewers.

1031
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,557
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1032
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,434
Get every available cop down there
and smoke him out!

1033
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,140
The mayor won't want panic.

1034
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,476
So it's a training exercise.

1035
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,314
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1036
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,150
Not you.

1037
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,690
You're telling me the Batman's gone...

1038
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,578
so you chase up the Daggett leads
any way you can.

1039
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,950
Yes, sir.

1040
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:04,846
He asks how much you would pay us
to let you die.

1041
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,005
I told him. I told him you have nothing.

1042
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,008
Do it for the pleasure.

1043
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,478
They pay me more than that
to keep you alive.

1044
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,112
He will try the climb.

1045
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,046
Has anyone ever made it?

1046
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,423
Of course not.

1047
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,303
He says there is one who did.

1048
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,813
A child.

1049
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,104
<i>A child born in this hell.</i>

1050
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,611
Bane.

1051
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,906
An old legend. Nothing more.

1052
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,865
Don't.

1053
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:15,408
Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.

1054
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,810
Fire in the hole!

1055
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,049
Turn it on.

1056
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,607
I only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.

1057
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,233
I won't do it.

1058
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,772
All right, stop.

1059
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,235
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...

1060
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,196
and you'll barely slow them down.

1061
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,020
Go on, then. Do your work.

1062
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,143
Take them up to the surface.

1063
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,186
People of their status...

1064
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:12,609
deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization.

1065
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,665
<i>I've been to half of
Daggett's cement plants</i>

1066
01:25:18,678 --> 01:25:20,742
<i>and locations they
poured underground.</i>

1067
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,285
<i>Anything strange about the pourings?</i>

1068
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:27,252
Honestly, commissioner, I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1069
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,338
But you know about patterns.
Keep looking.

1070
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:36,882
<i>It's done.</i>

1071
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:41,395
This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.

1072
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,391
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1073
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,810
No, you cannot.

1074
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,819
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1075
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,077
If you move it,
the core will decay in a matter of months.

1076
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,408
Five, by my calculations.

1077
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,244
And then it will go off!

1078
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:07,004
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...

1079
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,415
indeed I hope it does.

1080
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,756
Hey. Hey!

1081
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,840
That was you in front
of the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1082
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:20,138
When?
When?

1083
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,439
When cops were trying
to pull onto Castle

1084
01:26:22,452 --> 01:26:24,601
Street and your truck
was shutting them out.

1085
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:28,313
Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
Detective now.

1086
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,480
And, uh, as a detective, we're not
allowed to believe in coincidence.

1087
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:45,243
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1088
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,296
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1089
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:59,010
I got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions. Call me whenev...

1090
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:02,768
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1091
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,806
That looks like motor oil right next to it.

1092
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:10,192
Jesus, they're not making cement.
They're making explosives.

1093
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,652
<i>Patch me in to Foley.
Foley's overseeing the operation.</i>

1094
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,162
They're heading into a trap!

1095
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:26,033
<i>We're seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers.</i>

1096
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,669
Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.
It's a training exercise, that's all.

1097
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,878
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1098
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,794
<i>Foley.
It's a trap! Pull everyone out!</i>

1099
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,508
Bane has been pouring concrete...

1100
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,639
laced with explosives! Where?

1101
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:51,393
<i>Oh, say, can you see
By the dawn's early light.</i>

1102
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,945
<i>What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's...</i>

1103
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:02,028
<i>There's a ring around the tunnels! They'll
blow it and trap the cops underground!</i>

1104
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,955
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

1105
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,210
<i>Through the perilous fight.</i>

1106
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,502
<i>O'er the ramparts we watched.</i>

1107
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,090
<i>Were so gallantly streaming.</i>

1108
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:23,299
<i>And the rockets' red glare.</i>

1109
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,720
<i>The bombs bursting in air.</i>

1110
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,979
<i>Gave proof through...</i>

1111
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,353
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1112
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:36,646
<i>That our ﬂag was still there.</i>

1113
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:45,437
<i>Oh, say does that star-spangled banner
Yet wave.</i>

1114
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:52,708
<i>O'er the land of the free.</i>

1115
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:59,718
<i>And the home of the brave.</i>

1116
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,937
Let the games begin.

1117
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,307
Everybody okay?

1118
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,980
Let's move! Move, move!
Go, go!

1119
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,488
Gotham...

1120
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,454
take control.

1121
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,626
Take control of your city.

1122
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,711
Foley.
Jesus, Blake.

1123
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,801
Every cop in the city's in those tunnels.

1124
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,258
Not every cop.

1125
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,408
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.
I need your car right now.

1126
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,536
Clear the corners, rookie.

1127
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,914
Get my coat, son.

1128
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,832
This...

1129
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,795
This is the instrument of your liberation.

1130
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,308
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1131
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,432
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1132
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,145
Identify yourself to the world.

1133
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:51,905
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1134
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,619
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1135
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,328
Plane crash on an agency pull
out of Uzbekistan, but...

1136
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:00,450
It looks like it's him.

1137
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,996
And what...? What is this?

1138
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:08,042
It's a fully primed neutron bomb...

1139
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,586
with a blast radius of six miles.

1140
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,798
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1141
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,180
Only me.

1142
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,554
Only you.

1143
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,852
Thank you, good doctor!

1144
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,734
Now, this bomb is armed!

1145
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,490
And this bomb is mobile!

1146
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:37,200
And the identity of the triggerman
is a mystery.

1147
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:42,584
For one of you holds the detonator!

1148
01:33:43,007 --> 01:33:46,386
Now, we come here
not as conquerors...

1149
01:33:46,552 --> 01:33:52,150
but as liberators, to return control
of this city to the people.

1150
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:58,073
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...

1151
01:33:58,773 --> 01:34:02,573
or from those people
attempting to flee...

1152
01:34:04,487 --> 01:34:07,115
this anonymous Gothamite...

1153
01:34:07,281 --> 01:34:12,162
this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.

1154
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,958
<i>For now, martial law is in effect.</i>

1155
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:22,468
Return to your homes,
hold your families close...

1156
01:34:23,756 --> 01:34:25,178
and wait.

1157
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:29,349
Tomorrow, you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1158
01:34:35,643 --> 01:34:37,270
Pull back the fighters.

1159
01:34:38,104 --> 01:34:40,698
Start high-level reconnaissance flights.

1160
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:43,447
Get the president on the line.

1161
01:35:03,963 --> 01:35:08,594
Tanks and planes
cannot stop us from detonating our device.

1162
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:14,353
Send an emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication.

1163
01:35:19,228 --> 01:35:21,322
How many of you are there, son?

1164
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,740
You don't have enough men to stop
12 million people from leaving this island.

1165
01:35:27,528 --> 01:35:29,951
No. No, we don't.

1166
01:35:30,114 --> 01:35:31,161
But you do.

1167
01:35:32,909 --> 01:35:36,163
Now, why the hell would I try
to help you keep your hostages?

1168
01:35:36,329 --> 01:35:39,333
If one person crosses this bridge...

1169
01:35:39,499 --> 01:35:41,297
Gotham gets blown to hell.

1170
01:35:47,215 --> 01:35:50,014
<i>The people of our greatest
city are resilient.</i>

1171
01:35:51,093 --> 01:35:54,643
<i>They have proven this before,
and they will prove it again.</i>

1172
01:35:56,599 --> 01:35:59,603
<i>We do not negotiate with terrorists...</i>

1173
01:36:00,478 --> 01:36:02,321
<i>but we do recognize realities.</i>

1174
01:36:03,397 --> 01:36:05,525
<i>As this situation develops...</i>

1175
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:09,199
<i>one thing must be understood
above all others.</i>

1176
01:36:11,364 --> 01:36:14,288
<i>People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.</i>

1177
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,793
What does that mean?

1178
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:18,708
It means we're on our own.

1179
01:36:19,205 --> 01:36:20,923
I have to get in front of a camera.

1180
01:36:21,374 --> 01:36:23,627
They will kill you the second
you show your face.

1181
01:36:24,377 --> 01:36:26,305
Bane says he's giving
Gotham back to the people.

1182
01:36:26,318 --> 01:36:28,257
They need to know I could lead.

1183
01:36:28,422 --> 01:36:30,015
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

1184
01:36:30,174 --> 01:36:31,721
Then he'll show his true colors.

1185
01:36:31,884 --> 01:36:33,511
And you'll be dead.

1186
01:36:52,154 --> 01:36:57,251
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.

1187
01:36:57,868 --> 01:36:59,336
Blackgate Prison...

1188
01:36:59,495 --> 01:37:03,090
where a thousand men have languished...

1189
01:37:03,249 --> 01:37:06,753
under the name of this man:

1190
01:37:06,919 --> 01:37:09,013
Harvey Dent.

1191
01:37:09,755 --> 01:37:12,349
Who has been held up to you...

1192
01:37:12,508 --> 01:37:17,014
<i>as the shining example of justice!</i>

1193
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:20,183
We're just gonna keep moving you
till we can get you in front of the camera.

1194
01:37:20,349 --> 01:37:24,320
You have been supplied
with a false idol to stop you...

1195
01:37:24,478 --> 01:37:26,901
tearing down this corrupt city!

1196
01:37:27,064 --> 01:37:28,691
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1197
01:37:28,858 --> 01:37:32,488
Let me tell you the
truth about Harvey Dent.

1198
01:37:32,653 --> 01:37:37,500
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...

1199
01:37:37,658 --> 01:37:40,036
<i>James Gordon:</i>

1200
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:43,965
<i>"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent."</i>

1201
01:37:44,123 --> 01:37:46,046
<i>He saved my boy...</i>

1202
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:50,676
<i>then took the blame
for Harvey's appalling crimes...</i>

1203
01:37:50,838 --> 01:37:53,466
so that I could, to my shame...

1204
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:57,263
<i>build a lie around this...</i>

1205
01:37:57,428 --> 01:38:00,147
<i>fallen idol.</i>

1206
01:38:02,433 --> 01:38:07,360
<i>I praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child.</i>

1207
01:38:07,563 --> 01:38:11,318
Well, I can no longer live with my lie.

1208
01:38:11,484 --> 01:38:15,239
It is time to trust the people of Gotham
with the truth...

1209
01:38:15,404 --> 01:38:19,500
"...and it is time for me to resign."

1210
01:38:20,451 --> 01:38:23,796
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1211
01:38:25,581 --> 01:38:29,802
And do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars?

1212
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,633
Of all the corrupt?

1213
01:38:35,424 --> 01:38:37,677
<i>Those men locked up
for eight years in Blackgate...</i>

1214
01:38:37,843 --> 01:38:42,098
and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.

1215
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,767
Gotham needed a hero.

1216
01:38:44,934 --> 01:38:49,155
Well, it needs it now more than ever,
but you betrayed everything you stood for.

1217
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:56,743
There's a point far out there
when the structures fail you...

1218
01:38:56,904 --> 01:38:59,783
when the rules aren't
weapons any more...

1219
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:03,961
they're shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.

1220
01:39:05,621 --> 01:39:09,046
One day, you may face...

1221
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,881
such a moment of crisis.

1222
01:39:11,043 --> 01:39:14,343
And in that moment,
I hope you have a friend like I did...

1223
01:39:15,005 --> 01:39:20,182
to plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean!

1224
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:24,395
Your hands look plenty filthy to me,
commissioner.

1225
01:39:26,016 --> 01:39:29,520
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

1226
01:39:31,814 --> 01:39:32,906
The rich!

1227
01:39:33,816 --> 01:39:35,784
The oppressors of generations...

1228
01:39:35,943 --> 01:39:40,119
who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.

1229
01:39:40,281 --> 01:39:43,330
And we give it back to you...

1230
01:39:43,951 --> 01:39:46,170
the people.

1231
01:39:47,246 --> 01:39:49,169
Gotham is yours!

1232
01:39:49,623 --> 01:39:52,968
None shall interfere. Do as you please.

1233
01:39:55,212 --> 01:39:58,716
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1234
01:39:58,883 --> 01:40:00,601
Open it!

1235
01:40:08,517 --> 01:40:11,566
Step forward, those who would serve...

1236
01:40:13,147 --> 01:40:14,899
for an army will be raised.

1237
01:40:19,153 --> 01:40:23,750
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...

1238
01:40:28,454 --> 01:40:33,961
and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure!

1239
01:40:38,547 --> 01:40:40,641
Courts will be convened.

1240
01:40:48,307 --> 01:40:50,605
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1241
01:40:55,397 --> 01:40:57,024
Blood will be shed!

1242
01:41:00,361 --> 01:41:03,035
The police will survive...

1243
01:41:03,197 --> 01:41:07,623
<i>as they learn to serve true justice.</i>

1244
01:41:08,744 --> 01:41:11,247
This great city...

1245
01:41:13,415 --> 01:41:14,917
it will endure.

1246
01:41:17,628 --> 01:41:21,383
<i>Gotham will survive!</i>

1247
01:41:43,195 --> 01:41:45,618
He says you must first fix your back.

1248
01:41:45,865 --> 01:41:46,991
How does he know?

1249
01:41:47,157 --> 01:41:48,579
He was the prison doctor.

1250
01:41:48,742 --> 01:41:52,622
He's a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure...

1251
01:41:52,788 --> 01:41:56,713
of powerful people,
including your masked friend.

1252
01:41:57,626 --> 01:41:59,128
How?

1253
01:42:00,379 --> 01:42:04,680
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1254
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:09,355
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1255
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:15,065
<i>The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...</i>

1256
01:42:15,853 --> 01:42:17,480
left him in perpetual agony.

1257
01:42:17,646 --> 01:42:20,820
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1258
01:42:20,983 --> 01:42:24,328
Bane was the child you spoke of?

1259
01:42:24,486 --> 01:42:25,783
He was born here?

1260
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:31,210
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1261
01:42:31,952 --> 01:42:34,296
<i>He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.</i>

1262
01:42:34,788 --> 01:42:36,381
<i>They were married in secret.</i>

1263
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,542
When the warlord found out...

1264
01:42:39,043 --> 01:42:42,889
the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1265
01:42:43,464 --> 01:42:45,717
But then he exiled him instead.

1266
01:42:45,883 --> 01:42:49,933
<i>The mercenary understood that it was
the daughter who had secured his release.</i>

1267
01:42:50,095 --> 01:42:54,976
<i>But what he could not know
was the true price of his freedom.</i>

1268
01:42:56,018 --> 01:42:57,816
She took his place in the pit.

1269
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,487
And she was with child...

1270
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,573
<i>the mercenary's child.</i>

1271
01:43:07,154 --> 01:43:10,374
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

1272
01:43:12,993 --> 01:43:18,966
One day, the doctor forgot
to lock the cell.

1273
01:43:25,714 --> 01:43:28,058
<i>But the child had a friend...</i>

1274
01:43:28,509 --> 01:43:33,982
<i>a protector who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption.</i>

1275
01:43:34,139 --> 01:43:35,857
<i>It was to be prized.</i>

1276
01:43:36,016 --> 01:43:37,768
The mother was not so lucky.

1277
01:43:40,938 --> 01:43:44,613
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.

1278
01:43:55,995 --> 01:43:59,716
There's a vertebra protruding
from your back.

1279
01:44:00,082 --> 01:44:02,176
It has to be put back.

1280
01:44:07,172 --> 01:44:09,971
Stay like this until you stand.

1281
01:44:17,266 --> 01:44:22,898
Tsk, tsk, tsk, Did you
not think I would return, Bruce? Hmm?

1282
01:44:28,569 --> 01:44:30,196
I told you I was immortal.

1283
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,868
I watched... I watched you die.

1284
01:44:35,034 --> 01:44:38,004
Oh, there are many forms of immortality.

1285
01:44:39,913 --> 01:44:41,381
Once, I had a wife...

1286
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:44,634
my great love.

1287
01:44:46,003 --> 01:44:49,382
She was taken from me.
You were the mercenary.

1288
01:44:53,427 --> 01:44:55,395
Bane is your child.

1289
01:44:57,014 --> 01:44:58,061
Your heir.

1290
01:44:58,223 --> 01:45:00,976
An heir to ensure
the League of Shadows fulfills its duty...

1291
01:45:01,143 --> 01:45:03,771
to restore balance to civilization.

1292
01:45:03,937 --> 01:45:04,984
No.

1293
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:08,572
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years...

1294
01:45:08,734 --> 01:45:10,657
with all your strength...

1295
01:45:11,028 --> 01:45:15,249
all your resources,
all your moral authority.

1296
01:45:15,991 --> 01:45:18,995
And the only victory you could
achieve was a lie.

1297
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,499
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.

1298
01:45:22,664 --> 01:45:23,790
No.

1299
01:45:23,957 --> 01:45:26,085
And must be allowed to die.
No!

1300
01:45:33,008 --> 01:45:35,010
Yeah, just lift your head.

1301
01:45:35,427 --> 01:45:36,849
Oh, that's good.

1302
01:45:42,684 --> 01:45:43,731
No, no!

1303
01:46:19,096 --> 01:46:21,440
What's that?
This was someone's home.

1304
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:23,521
And now it's everyone's home.

1305
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:28,359
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.

1306
01:46:57,467 --> 01:47:00,266
It's for the bus,
in case there's a chance to evacuate.

1307
01:47:00,429 --> 01:47:01,976
Any news? Is the commissioner...?

1308
01:47:02,139 --> 01:47:05,484
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?

1309
01:47:05,642 --> 01:47:08,441
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.

1310
01:47:08,604 --> 01:47:09,947
It's good to see you.

1311
01:47:10,647 --> 01:47:14,697
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1312
01:47:20,407 --> 01:47:21,704
Why build yourself?

1313
01:47:24,036 --> 01:47:29,008
I'm not meant to die in here.
Here, there. What's the difference?

1314
01:48:30,727 --> 01:48:34,072
I told you it could not be done.

1315
01:48:34,231 --> 01:48:35,858
You told me a child did it.

1316
01:48:37,234 --> 01:48:39,532
But no ordinary child.

1317
01:48:39,695 --> 01:48:42,494
<i>A child born in hell.</i>

1318
01:48:46,827 --> 01:48:48,295
<i>Forged from suffering.</i>

1319
01:48:50,414 --> 01:48:52,712
<i>Hardened by pain.</i>

1320
01:48:54,251 --> 01:48:56,879
Not a man from privilege.

1321
01:49:15,939 --> 01:49:17,907
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1322
01:49:18,692 --> 01:49:19,784
Just waiting on intel.

1323
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:26,537
You have ID?

1324
01:49:27,242 --> 01:49:28,289
Of course not.

1325
01:49:28,452 --> 01:49:31,001
Well, how can we trust you?
We don't have any choice.

1326
01:49:31,872 --> 01:49:34,216
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1327
01:49:34,374 --> 01:49:35,921
Captain. Glad to have you here.

1328
01:49:36,084 --> 01:49:38,758
It's our job, sir.
Now, uh, how many of you are there?

1329
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,844
Well, there's dozens.
I'd rather not say exactly.

1330
01:49:42,007 --> 01:49:45,261
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.

1331
01:49:45,427 --> 01:49:47,350
<i>Condition?
Getting food and water.</i>

1332
01:49:47,512 --> 01:49:49,810
Can we break them out?
Yes, sir.

1333
01:49:49,973 --> 01:49:52,317
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.

1334
01:49:52,476 --> 01:49:55,195
<i>Blow the rubble, make a hole
big enough for 10 at a time.</i>

1335
01:49:55,354 --> 01:49:58,574
I'm in contact with my partner
who's down there. They're just waiting.

1336
01:49:58,732 --> 01:50:00,848
Men who haven't seen
daylight in months?

1337
01:50:00,861 --> 01:50:02,987
Officers who haven't
seen daylight in months.

1338
01:50:03,153 --> 01:50:05,827
What about the bomb? Satellite
can't pick up radiation hot spots.

1339
01:50:06,365 --> 01:50:09,744
<i>They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.</i>

1340
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:12,584
<i>They move it constantly.
Good. So you know the truck?</i>

1341
01:50:12,746 --> 01:50:16,091
<i>Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.</i>

1342
01:50:16,458 --> 01:50:17,505
Decoy.

1343
01:50:19,044 --> 01:50:22,469
You don't really think he's coming back?
Doesn't matter what I think.

1344
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:26,511
Actually, it does. You should put your
faith in something a little more real.

1345
01:50:26,676 --> 01:50:29,896
<i>The routes don't vary much.
Okay. What about the triggerman?</i>

1346
01:50:30,055 --> 01:50:34,105
No leads. It's a bluff. Bane wouldn't give
control of that bomb to someone else.

1347
01:50:34,267 --> 01:50:38,488
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the triggerman, we just track the device.

1348
01:50:38,647 --> 01:50:42,572
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under
a warlord, like some failed state?

1349
01:50:42,734 --> 01:50:45,613
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

1350
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:48,396
We can't do anything to
risk millions of lives.

1351
01:50:48,409 --> 01:50:51,036
You gonna tell him
what's really going on?

1352
01:50:51,201 --> 01:50:54,296
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1353
01:50:54,454 --> 01:50:56,673
<i>There's someone you need to meet.</i>

1354
01:50:56,998 --> 01:51:00,878
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.
Found the people who run the corporation.

1355
01:51:01,044 --> 01:51:02,216
What corporation?

1356
01:51:02,379 --> 01:51:04,757
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1357
01:51:13,807 --> 01:51:15,980
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?

1358
01:51:16,184 --> 01:51:18,778
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.

1359
01:51:18,937 --> 01:51:23,408
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1360
01:51:23,567 --> 01:51:25,569
Why?
We built it.

1361
01:51:25,735 --> 01:51:27,237
You built the bomb?

1362
01:51:27,404 --> 01:51:31,580
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

1363
01:51:31,741 --> 01:51:35,120
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1364
01:51:35,287 --> 01:51:38,666
Here's the important part.
As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1365
01:51:38,832 --> 01:51:40,755
it becomes increasingly unstable...

1366
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:42,464
to the point of detonation.

1367
01:51:42,627 --> 01:51:44,379
This bomb is a time bomb.

1368
01:51:44,546 --> 01:51:48,551
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...

1369
01:51:48,717 --> 01:51:51,436
or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.

1370
01:51:51,595 --> 01:51:54,189
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1371
01:51:54,723 --> 01:51:56,947
Could you disarm it?

1372
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,194
I could reconnect it to the reactor.
Stabilize it.

1373
01:51:59,352 --> 01:52:00,905
Let's move from this
location and call it in.

1374
01:52:00,918 --> 01:52:02,481
Right. Let's go.

1375
01:52:02,647 --> 01:52:05,867
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1376
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,452
Someone sold us out.

1377
01:52:16,077 --> 01:52:17,545
Go, go, go!

1378
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:40,944
I'll die before I talk.

1379
01:52:41,645 --> 01:52:43,898
I'm on your schedule, captain.

1380
01:52:50,362 --> 01:52:52,706
There were people living upstairs.

1381
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:55,326
Round them up forjudgment...

1382
01:52:59,162 --> 01:53:04,043
and hang them where the world can see.

1383
01:53:06,086 --> 01:53:10,887
<i>Police have cordoned off the entire
Central Heights and East Park Side areas...</i>

1384
01:53:11,049 --> 01:53:15,145
<i>as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt...</i>

1385
01:53:18,765 --> 01:53:22,815
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1386
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:25,238
My body makes the jump.

1387
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:29,610
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1388
01:53:32,529 --> 01:53:35,499
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.

1389
01:53:35,657 --> 01:53:38,661
Fear is why you fail.

1390
01:53:38,952 --> 01:53:40,499
No, I'm not afraid.

1391
01:53:42,163 --> 01:53:43,665
I'm angry.

1392
01:54:12,902 --> 01:54:14,370
Bruce.

1393
01:54:15,572 --> 01:54:16,664
Why do we fall?

1394
01:54:22,704 --> 01:54:24,581
You do not fear death.

1395
01:54:25,624 --> 01:54:30,175
You think this makes you strong.
It makes you weak.

1396
01:54:30,712 --> 01:54:31,759
Why?

1397
01:54:31,921 --> 01:54:34,174
How can you move faster than possible...

1398
01:54:34,466 --> 01:54:36,935
fight longer than possible...

1399
01:54:37,218 --> 01:54:40,813
without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit?

1400
01:54:42,057 --> 01:54:43,684
The fear of death.

1401
01:54:44,392 --> 01:54:46,269
I do fear death.

1402
01:54:48,063 --> 01:54:50,031
I fear dying in here...

1403
01:54:50,815 --> 01:54:52,738
while my city burns.

1404
01:54:53,777 --> 01:54:55,700
There's no one there to save it.

1405
01:54:57,072 --> 01:54:58,574
Then make the climb.

1406
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:04,963
How?

1407
01:55:06,456 --> 01:55:08,254
As the child did...

1408
01:55:12,962 --> 01:55:14,635
without the rope.

1409
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,598
Then fear will find you again.

1410
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:28,854
Ah, supplies for your journey?

1411
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:31,114
Oh, that's wonderful. That's...

1412
01:55:35,652 --> 01:55:37,279
What does that mean?

1413
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:39,073
Rise.

1414
01:55:40,407 --> 01:55:41,454
No.

1415
01:57:11,414 --> 01:57:13,337
No, there's been a mistake!

1416
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,502
Take me to Bane!

1417
01:57:18,087 --> 01:57:19,760
I want to see Bane!

1418
01:57:23,009 --> 01:57:24,101
Order!

1419
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,013
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

1420
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:29,308
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

1421
01:57:29,682 --> 01:57:32,105
You are Philip Stryver...

1422
01:57:32,268 --> 01:57:35,772
executive vice president
of Daggett Industries...

1423
01:57:35,939 --> 01:57:39,569
who for years has been living off
the blood and sweat...

1424
01:57:39,734 --> 01:57:41,953
of people less powerful than him.

1425
01:57:42,111 --> 01:57:45,206
Call Bane. I am one of you.

1426
01:57:45,448 --> 01:57:48,998
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1427
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:51,288
Now, the choice is yours.

1428
01:57:51,454 --> 01:57:53,877
Exile or death!

1429
01:57:58,503 --> 01:57:59,925
Order!

1430
01:58:00,505 --> 01:58:01,802
Exi... Exile.

1431
01:58:02,549 --> 01:58:03,971
Sold.

1432
01:58:04,133 --> 01:58:05,885
To the man in the cold sweat.

1433
01:58:13,268 --> 01:58:14,690
You follow the thick ice.

1434
01:58:14,853 --> 01:58:16,981
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1435
01:58:17,146 --> 01:58:18,739
Has anyone made it?

1436
01:58:32,161 --> 01:58:34,584
<i>Where are they?
It's not like we have a lot of time.</i>

1437
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:36,165
How long?

1438
01:58:36,332 --> 01:58:38,175
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1439
01:58:38,585 --> 01:58:41,589
We have about 18 hours to do something.
To do what?

1440
01:58:41,754 --> 01:58:43,745
To mark the truck. Get
a GPS on it so we can

1441
01:58:43,758 --> 01:58:45,759
start to figure out
how to bring it down.

1442
01:58:52,473 --> 01:58:53,725
That's it?

1443
01:58:56,227 --> 01:58:57,319
Foley.

1444
01:58:58,855 --> 01:59:02,780
Where's Foley, damn it?
You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1445
01:59:07,488 --> 01:59:10,412
Jim, he's not here.
You let your wife come to the door?

1446
01:59:10,575 --> 01:59:13,624
When the city's under occupation?
Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1447
01:59:13,786 --> 01:59:16,414
What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?

1448
01:59:16,581 --> 01:59:18,709
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1449
01:59:18,875 --> 01:59:21,219
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?

1450
01:59:21,377 --> 01:59:24,506
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?

1451
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,725
That was different. These
guys run the city.

1452
01:59:26,738 --> 01:59:28,802
The government's done
a deal with them.

1453
01:59:28,968 --> 01:59:31,517
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1454
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:34,979
You move on Bane,
the triggerman is gonna hit the button.

1455
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:39,112
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?

1456
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,272
You think this is part of some revolution?

1457
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:44,283
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

1458
01:59:44,442 --> 01:59:47,537
Look, we've all got to keep our heads
down till they can fix this.

1459
01:59:47,695 --> 01:59:51,325
If you still had a family here...
This only gets fixed from inside...

1460
01:59:51,491 --> 01:59:53,084
the city!

1461
01:59:53,409 --> 01:59:55,082
Look, Peter.

1462
01:59:56,037 --> 01:59:58,324
I'm not asking you to
walk down Grand in your

1463
01:59:58,337 --> 02:00:00,634
dress blues, but something
has to be done.

1464
02:00:00,792 --> 02:00:02,840
Sorry, Jim. I gotta...
Keep your head down?

1465
02:00:03,002 --> 02:00:05,175
What goods that gonna do
when that thing blows?

1466
02:00:05,338 --> 02:00:07,807
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1467
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:14,268
I hear you're looking for men,
commissioner.

1468
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:15,682
How about me instead?

1469
02:00:15,848 --> 02:00:18,442
Miss Tate, I, uh, can't ask you to do that.

1470
02:00:19,394 --> 02:00:20,441
Please.

1471
02:00:22,021 --> 02:00:24,194
You little punk! What'd you take?

1472
02:00:24,357 --> 02:00:26,655
Nothing! I didn't take anything!

1473
02:00:26,818 --> 02:00:30,118
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1474
02:00:30,697 --> 02:00:34,702
Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.

1475
02:00:40,623 --> 02:00:43,877
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.

1476
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:52,598
You're pretty generous for a thief.

1477
02:01:01,269 --> 02:01:04,022
I thought they killed you.
Not yet.

1478
02:01:04,355 --> 02:01:07,529
If you're expecting an apology, I...
It wouldn't suit you.

1479
02:01:08,943 --> 02:01:09,990
I need your help.

1480
02:01:10,528 --> 02:01:11,996
And why would I help you?

1481
02:01:12,155 --> 02:01:14,157
For this. Clean slate.

1482
02:01:14,323 --> 02:01:16,325
You'd trust me with that?

1483
02:01:16,909 --> 02:01:18,536
After what I did to you?

1484
02:01:18,703 --> 02:01:21,627
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

1485
02:01:23,249 --> 02:01:26,378
But I still think there's more to you.
In fact, I think that for you...

1486
02:01:26,794 --> 02:01:28,137
this isn't just a tool.

1487
02:01:28,296 --> 02:01:31,516
It's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.

1488
02:01:32,425 --> 02:01:35,395
I can't even get off this island.
I can give you a way off...

1489
02:01:35,553 --> 02:01:37,100
once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1490
02:01:37,263 --> 02:01:40,062
Find out where they're holding him
and take me in.

1491
02:01:43,811 --> 02:01:44,903
Why do you need Fox?

1492
02:01:45,063 --> 02:01:47,566
To save the city.
Who says it needs saving?

1493
02:01:47,732 --> 02:01:49,325
Maybe I like it this way.

1494
02:01:49,484 --> 02:01:51,111
Maybe you do...

1495
02:01:52,487 --> 02:01:54,831
but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1496
02:01:57,408 --> 02:01:59,126
Got your powerful friend on the case?

1497
02:01:59,285 --> 02:02:00,628
I'm trying...

1498
02:02:01,454 --> 02:02:03,081
but I need Fox.

1499
02:02:03,247 --> 02:02:04,999
As it approaches...

1500
02:02:05,792 --> 02:02:06,964
flip the switch.

1501
02:02:07,126 --> 02:02:10,676
The needle hits 200, you give me the
signal, I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1502
02:02:12,048 --> 02:02:13,675
Heads up, heads up.

1503
02:02:29,774 --> 02:02:32,072
I got it.
Mercenaries on your 6.

1504
02:02:32,235 --> 02:02:35,364
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1505
02:02:37,573 --> 02:02:39,621
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.

1506
02:02:39,784 --> 02:02:41,502
On whose authority?

1507
02:02:41,661 --> 02:02:42,878
The people of Gotham.

1508
02:02:43,871 --> 02:02:48,798
No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort of due process is this?

1509
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:52,180
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1510
02:02:52,588 --> 02:02:54,181
Now, what will it be?

1511
02:02:55,383 --> 02:02:58,102
Death or exile?

1512
02:02:58,261 --> 02:03:03,017
Crane, if you think we're going out
onto that ice willingly...

1513
02:03:03,182 --> 02:03:04,775
you have another thing coming.

1514
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:08,613
Death, then.

1515
02:03:08,771 --> 02:03:10,990
Looks that way.
Very well.

1516
02:03:11,149 --> 02:03:12,651
Death...

1517
02:03:13,985 --> 02:03:15,703
by exile.

1518
02:03:18,281 --> 02:03:19,749
Bring her to me.

1519
02:03:26,247 --> 02:03:30,468
Hey, we're going now.
Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!

1520
02:03:30,626 --> 02:03:33,675
Hey, you hear me?
We're going now. Let's do it.

1521
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:40,053
Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.

1522
02:03:40,219 --> 02:03:43,393
We all do.
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1523
02:03:45,641 --> 02:03:47,018
Bruce.
You okay?

1524
02:03:47,185 --> 02:03:49,563
Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation,
Mr. Wayne.

1525
02:03:49,729 --> 02:03:51,402
How long until that core ignites?

1526
02:03:51,564 --> 02:03:53,475
That bomb goes
off in 12 hours.

1527
02:03:53,488 --> 02:03:55,410
Unless we can reconnect
it to the reactor.

1528
02:03:56,152 --> 02:03:59,281
Can you get Miranda out of here?
Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1529
02:04:00,072 --> 02:04:02,325
Do what's necessary.
Tonight I need you.

1530
02:04:02,491 --> 02:04:04,914
What for?
To get me back in the game.

1531
02:04:05,077 --> 02:04:09,253
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1532
02:04:11,584 --> 02:04:14,679
I won't forget about you, Miranda.
I know.

1533
02:04:23,971 --> 02:04:25,769
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

1534
02:04:25,932 --> 02:04:27,775
He should be so lucky.

1535
02:04:33,522 --> 02:04:36,275
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...

1536
02:04:36,442 --> 02:04:38,319
the triggerman sets it off.

1537
02:04:38,486 --> 02:04:41,285
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.

1538
02:04:41,447 --> 02:04:43,120
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1539
02:04:43,282 --> 02:04:46,035
It'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.

1540
02:04:46,202 --> 02:04:48,000
Could you block it?
Yes.

1541
02:04:48,162 --> 02:04:51,792
But I'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.

1542
02:04:52,959 --> 02:04:54,586
Remember where you parked?

1543
02:05:08,975 --> 02:05:10,443
She ﬂy okay?

1544
02:05:11,477 --> 02:05:14,196
Yeah, even without the autopilot.

1545
02:05:14,355 --> 02:05:17,325
Thanks.
Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1546
02:05:57,064 --> 02:05:59,863
Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick.
One at a time.

1547
02:06:03,779 --> 02:06:05,122
Wait, wait!

1548
02:06:06,449 --> 02:06:07,917
Ross!

1549
02:06:08,075 --> 02:06:09,452
Ross?

1550
02:06:10,077 --> 02:06:12,171
Lock it up.
No, keep down.

1551
02:06:12,830 --> 02:06:14,423
Get down!

1552
02:06:16,042 --> 02:06:17,294
Who are you?

1553
02:06:46,697 --> 02:06:47,994
Light it up.

1554
02:07:05,966 --> 02:07:09,140
Dad, check it out.
Honey, come take a look.

1555
02:07:19,522 --> 02:07:21,240
Impossible.

1556
02:07:22,024 --> 02:07:23,776
Keep her close.

1557
02:07:24,443 --> 02:07:26,116
He'll come for her.

1558
02:07:26,445 --> 02:07:28,197
Where's Miranda Tate?

1559
02:07:28,864 --> 02:07:30,332
Bane took her.

1560
02:07:30,533 --> 02:07:33,833
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1561
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:36,623
This blocks the remote detonator signal
to the bomb.

1562
02:07:36,789 --> 02:07:40,464
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.

1563
02:07:41,377 --> 02:07:42,549
When what starts?

1564
02:07:43,045 --> 02:07:44,262
War.

1565
02:08:20,124 --> 02:08:21,250
You missed a spot.

1566
02:08:24,837 --> 02:08:27,266
If you're working
alone, wear a mask.

1567
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:29,718
I'm not afraid to be
seen standing up to them.

1568
02:08:29,884 --> 02:08:33,104
The mask is not for you.
It's to protect the people you care about.

1569
02:08:34,805 --> 02:08:36,773
Count to five, then throw.

1570
02:08:47,151 --> 02:08:49,825
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1571
02:09:00,247 --> 02:09:03,376
What now?
All-out assault on Bane.

1572
02:09:03,542 --> 02:09:05,795
But you need to get people
across the bridge.

1573
02:09:05,961 --> 02:09:08,214
Why?
In case we fail.

1574
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:11,099
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1575
02:09:11,258 --> 02:09:12,555
You don't need me here?

1576
02:09:12,718 --> 02:09:14,265
You've given me an army.

1577
02:09:14,428 --> 02:09:15,600
Now go.

1578
02:09:16,347 --> 02:09:17,439
Hey, thanks.

1579
02:09:17,598 --> 02:09:18,941
Don't thank me yet.

1580
02:09:19,099 --> 02:09:21,147
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1581
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:36,708
You shouldn't have.

1582
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:39,833
The midtown tunnel's
blocked by debris...

1583
02:09:39,995 --> 02:09:43,374
but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.

1584
02:09:43,541 --> 02:09:45,384
Wait until the fighting begins.

1585
02:09:45,543 --> 02:09:48,262
You're gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend?

1586
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:49,467
To start it, throttle...

1587
02:09:51,257 --> 02:09:54,431
I got it.
We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1588
02:09:54,593 --> 02:09:57,346
No, I've got 45 minutes to get clear
of the blast radius.

1589
02:09:57,513 --> 02:09:59,151
You don't stand a chance
against these guys.

1590
02:09:59,164 --> 02:10:00,813
With your help, I might.

1591
02:10:00,975 --> 02:10:03,353
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1592
02:10:04,436 --> 02:10:06,029
There's more to you than that.

1593
02:10:09,692 --> 02:10:11,786
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1594
02:10:15,447 --> 02:10:16,994
Come with me.

1595
02:10:18,284 --> 02:10:19,877
Save yourself.

1596
02:10:22,121 --> 02:10:24,840
You don't owe these people any more.

1597
02:10:24,999 --> 02:10:27,127
You've given them everything.

1598
02:10:27,293 --> 02:10:28,761
Not everything.

1599
02:10:29,169 --> 02:10:30,421
Not yet.

1600
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:12,134
Disperse!

1601
02:11:12,296 --> 02:11:14,515
Disperse or be fired upon!

1602
02:11:15,924 --> 02:11:18,302
There's only one police in this town.

1603
02:11:57,299 --> 02:11:58,972
Open fire.

1604
02:12:50,185 --> 02:12:51,903
Here it comes!
Get ready!

1605
02:13:21,759 --> 02:13:25,855
So you came back to die with your city.

1606
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:29,980
No. I came back to stop you.

1607
02:13:41,028 --> 02:13:42,075
Now!

1608
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,627
That's impossible.

1609
02:13:58,504 --> 02:14:00,131
Cut over to Fifth!

1610
02:14:14,186 --> 02:14:16,188
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1611
02:14:16,355 --> 02:14:18,949
You, come with me. You too.

1612
02:14:19,149 --> 02:14:22,198
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.

1613
02:14:22,361 --> 02:14:24,204
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1614
02:14:24,363 --> 02:14:27,037
You guys, you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?

1615
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:31,079
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by
the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

1616
02:14:31,245 --> 02:14:33,964
You do two blocks and you get back
to the bus, all right?

1617
02:14:34,122 --> 02:14:35,999
Go, go, go!

1618
02:14:36,166 --> 02:14:37,543
Is he back?

1619
02:14:38,919 --> 02:14:40,262
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

1620
02:16:02,878 --> 02:16:04,425
Cover the doors!

1621
02:16:07,591 --> 02:16:09,138
Where's your trigger?!

1622
02:16:09,468 --> 02:16:11,095
Where is it?!

1623
02:16:12,012 --> 02:16:14,856
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!

1624
02:16:15,015 --> 02:16:17,643
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

1625
02:16:19,019 --> 02:16:21,738
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1626
02:16:29,529 --> 02:16:31,657
Tell me where the trigger is.

1627
02:16:32,157 --> 02:16:35,752
Then you have my permission to die.

1628
02:16:47,881 --> 02:16:49,599
I broke you.

1629
02:16:50,884 --> 02:16:52,761
How have you come back?

1630
02:16:52,928 --> 02:16:57,434
You think you're the only one who could
learn the strength to escape?

1631
02:16:57,599 --> 02:16:58,896
Where's the trigger?

1632
02:16:59,559 --> 02:17:01,903
But I never escaped.

1633
02:17:02,771 --> 02:17:04,318
But the child.

1634
02:17:06,108 --> 02:17:08,156
The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.

1635
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:10,696
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1636
02:17:14,616 --> 02:17:15,959
I am.

1637
02:17:16,410 --> 02:17:18,833
And though I'm not ordinary...

1638
02:17:20,163 --> 02:17:21,881
I am a citizen.

1639
02:17:41,476 --> 02:17:42,648
Miranda?

1640
02:17:45,522 --> 02:17:46,569
Why?

1641
02:17:47,315 --> 02:17:48,658
Talia.

1642
02:17:49,484 --> 02:17:52,533
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...

1643
02:17:53,363 --> 02:17:56,788
the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector...

1644
02:17:57,242 --> 02:17:58,289
<i>Bane.</i>

1645
02:18:06,251 --> 02:18:07,423
Goodbye.

1646
02:18:09,671 --> 02:18:11,799
I climbed out of the pit.

1647
02:18:17,763 --> 02:18:19,561
<i>I found my father...</i>

1648
02:18:22,517 --> 02:18:25,646
and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1649
02:18:26,521 --> 02:18:28,273
<i>But by that time...</i>

1650
02:18:29,399 --> 02:18:33,154
the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend.

1651
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:34,537
<i>My protector.</i>

1652
02:18:38,533 --> 02:18:40,035
<i>The League took us in.</i>

1653
02:18:40,410 --> 02:18:41,957
Trained us.

1654
02:18:42,329 --> 02:18:45,128
But my father could not accept Bane.

1655
02:18:45,665 --> 02:18:47,417
<i>He saw only a monster.</i>

1656
02:18:47,584 --> 02:18:53,466
His very existence was a reminder
of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

1657
02:18:53,882 --> 02:18:57,011
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1658
02:18:57,177 --> 02:19:01,728
His only crime was that he loved me.

1659
02:19:03,517 --> 02:19:06,441
I could not forgive my father.

1660
02:19:11,066 --> 02:19:12,739
Until you murdered him.

1661
02:19:30,585 --> 02:19:36,058
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.

1662
02:19:36,341 --> 02:19:39,971
Innocent is a strong word
to throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1663
02:19:42,597 --> 02:19:45,646
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1664
02:19:57,821 --> 02:20:02,702
Vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience.

1665
02:20:04,202 --> 02:20:05,294
You see...

1666
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:08,173
it's the slow knife...

1667
02:20:08,331 --> 02:20:10,959
the knife that takes its time.

1668
02:20:14,754 --> 02:20:15,971
The knife...

1669
02:20:16,798 --> 02:20:20,393
that waits years without forgetting...

1670
02:20:20,677 --> 02:20:23,977
then slips quietly between the bones.

1671
02:20:25,015 --> 02:20:26,312
That's the knife...

1672
02:20:27,642 --> 02:20:28,985
that cuts deepest.

1673
02:20:29,144 --> 02:20:30,270
Please.

1674
02:20:37,986 --> 02:20:39,988
Maybe your knife...

1675
02:20:40,989 --> 02:20:42,411
was too slow.

1676
02:20:42,574 --> 02:20:43,996
The truck is under attack.

1677
02:20:44,159 --> 02:20:47,914
Gordon.
You gave him a way to block my signal.

1678
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:49,126
No matter.

1679
02:20:51,666 --> 02:20:53,760
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1680
02:20:58,131 --> 02:20:59,633
Come on!

1681
02:21:00,258 --> 02:21:01,680
This Way!

1682
02:21:07,265 --> 02:21:09,688
Stay there! What are you doing?

1683
02:21:10,143 --> 02:21:13,488
Blake, MCU!
I'm getting these boys to safety!

1684
02:21:13,647 --> 02:21:14,990
You'll get us all killed!

1685
02:21:15,148 --> 02:21:18,152
If anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!

1686
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:21,697
It's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!

1687
02:21:21,863 --> 02:21:25,037
Detective, if you take one step forward
we will shoot you!

1688
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:28,795
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

1689
02:21:30,872 --> 02:21:34,172
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Go back and wait.

1690
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:41,391
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.

1691
02:21:42,717 --> 02:21:46,438
Don't kill him,
I want him to feel the heat.

1692
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:52,061
Feel the fire of 12
million souls you failed.

1693
02:21:57,983 --> 02:21:59,530
Goodbye, my friend.

1694
02:22:07,617 --> 02:22:08,994
Goodbye.

1695
02:22:09,536 --> 02:22:13,040
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

1696
02:22:21,256 --> 02:22:23,008
Shoot them.

1697
02:22:23,675 --> 02:22:25,143
Shoot them all.

1698
02:22:34,352 --> 02:22:37,982
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1699
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:43,119
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1700
02:22:50,952 --> 02:22:53,000
About the whole no-guns thing...

1701
02:22:53,955 --> 02:22:57,004
I'm not sure I feel as strongly
about it as you do.

1702
02:23:10,388 --> 02:23:12,015
Pull up.

1703
02:23:14,726 --> 02:23:16,148
Stay level.

1704
02:23:28,531 --> 02:23:31,831
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

1705
02:23:33,661 --> 02:23:36,665
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go.

1706
02:23:36,915 --> 02:23:40,169
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.

1707
02:23:40,877 --> 02:23:44,347
I'm a cop, like you,
and I'm walking out there.

1708
02:23:45,173 --> 02:23:47,267
Please do not shoot me!

1709
02:23:49,219 --> 02:23:50,345
Shoot at his feet.

1710
02:24:00,355 --> 02:24:02,699
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1711
02:24:02,857 --> 02:24:04,951
Detective! Please stop!

1712
02:24:05,527 --> 02:24:08,622
Please, detective! Stop!

1713
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:10,623
Stop walking!

1714
02:24:11,491 --> 02:24:14,210
Blow it! Do it!

1715
02:24:25,505 --> 02:24:27,883
You have to get that bomb here.
You've got 10 minutes.

1716
02:24:38,852 --> 02:24:41,150
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.

1717
02:24:41,312 --> 02:24:43,781
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1718
02:24:45,066 --> 02:24:46,613
You idiots!

1719
02:24:46,901 --> 02:24:48,699
You sons of bitches!

1720
02:24:48,862 --> 02:24:50,614
You're killing us!

1721
02:24:50,780 --> 02:24:52,407
Yeah, follow your orders!

1722
02:24:52,782 --> 02:24:55,080
All right, boys. Get in a circle.
Bow your heads.

1723
02:24:57,996 --> 02:24:59,794
It's on my side.

1724
02:25:47,754 --> 02:25:50,883
Hey, Father! Let's get everyone back
on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!

1725
02:25:51,049 --> 02:25:54,223
Back on the bus!
There's nowhere to go.

1726
02:25:54,761 --> 02:25:55,808
On the bus!

1727
02:26:52,694 --> 02:26:54,822
You've got to turn the truck east!

1728
02:26:59,742 --> 02:27:01,494
Stay straight!

1729
02:27:33,234 --> 02:27:36,613
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1730
02:27:43,369 --> 02:27:46,213
Fox showed me how to override
the reactor.

1731
02:27:49,959 --> 02:27:51,211
Oh, dear.

1732
02:27:54,922 --> 02:27:58,267
Including the emergency flood.

1733
02:28:14,651 --> 02:28:16,574
There's no way...

1734
02:28:17,487 --> 02:28:18,739
this bomb...

1735
02:28:19,614 --> 02:28:21,161
will be stopped.

1736
02:28:22,367 --> 02:28:23,493
What are you doing?

1737
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:26,038
Protection from the blast.
We're gonna be all right!

1738
02:28:26,204 --> 02:28:27,501
It's an atom bomb!

1739
02:28:27,664 --> 02:28:30,338
Think they need to hear that?
Let them die without hope? Come on!

1740
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:32,923
Prepare yourselves.

1741
02:28:34,629 --> 02:28:36,677
My father's work...

1742
02:28:37,924 --> 02:28:39,597
is done.

1743
02:28:45,390 --> 02:28:48,314
What are you doing?
I can get it out over the bay!

1744
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:50,987
Set it to fly out
over the water, then eject?

1745
02:28:51,145 --> 02:28:52,772
No autopilot.

1746
02:28:54,399 --> 02:28:57,778
You could've gone anywhere, been anything.
But you came back here.

1747
02:28:57,944 --> 02:28:59,070
So did you.

1748
02:28:59,529 --> 02:29:01,577
I guess we're both suckers.

1749
02:29:09,247 --> 02:29:12,091
I never cared who you were.
And you were right.

1750
02:29:12,250 --> 02:29:14,844
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1751
02:29:15,002 --> 02:29:16,174
A hero can be anyone.

1752
02:29:16,337 --> 02:29:19,261
Even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring...

1753
02:29:19,424 --> 02:29:23,304
as putting a coat around a young boy's
shoulders to let him know...

1754
02:29:23,469 --> 02:29:25,267
the world hadn't ended.

1755
02:29:42,989 --> 02:29:44,457
Bruce Wayne?

1756
02:29:57,545 --> 02:30:00,674
Come on! There you go!
Okay, you too. Come on, Father.

1757
02:30:19,942 --> 02:30:21,819
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1758
02:30:22,153 --> 02:30:25,077
No.
No, that's Batman!

1759
02:31:13,287 --> 02:31:14,584
That's detonation!

1760
02:31:22,046 --> 02:31:23,969
It's out over the bay! Clear of the city!

1761
02:31:43,818 --> 02:31:46,662
<i>"I see a beautiful city..."</i>

1762
02:31:46,821 --> 02:31:48,949
<i>and a brilliant people...</i>

1763
02:31:49,198 --> 02:31:51,200
<i>rising from this abyss.</i>

1764
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:56,415
<i>I see the lives for which
I lay down my life...</i>

1765
02:31:56,831 --> 02:31:58,048
<i>peaceful...</i>

1766
02:31:58,791 --> 02:32:02,045
<i>useful, prosperous and happy.</i>

1767
02:32:04,505 --> 02:32:08,135
<i>I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...</i>

1768
02:32:09,969 --> 02:32:13,143
<i>and in the hearts
of their descendants...</i>

1769
02:32:13,973 --> 02:32:15,691
<i>generations hence.</i>

1770
02:32:18,394 --> 02:32:22,615
It is a far, far better thing that I do...

1771
02:32:23,482 --> 02:32:25,450
than I have ever done.

1772
02:32:26,485 --> 02:32:30,991
It is a far, far better
rest that I go to...

1773
02:32:33,910 --> 02:32:35,628
"...than I have ever known."

1774
02:32:53,971 --> 02:32:55,393
I'm so sorry.

1775
02:32:55,765 --> 02:32:57,483
I failed you.

1776
02:32:59,518 --> 02:33:01,145
You trusted me...

1777
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:03,856
and I failed you.

1778
02:33:07,985 --> 02:33:09,783
Can I change your mind...

1779
02:33:12,114 --> 02:33:14,037
about quitting the force?

1780
02:33:14,951 --> 02:33:18,797
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

1781
02:33:19,163 --> 02:33:22,713
You were right, and I can't take it.
The injustice.

1782
02:33:22,917 --> 02:33:27,218
I mean, no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1783
02:33:27,421 --> 02:33:28,513
They know.

1784
02:33:30,424 --> 02:33:32,142
It was the Batman.

1785
02:33:50,194 --> 02:33:53,789
<i>Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.</i>

1786
02:33:53,948 --> 02:33:57,794
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of.

1787
02:33:57,952 --> 02:34:01,422
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts...

1788
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:05,926
<i>and the remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.</i>

1789
02:34:07,378 --> 02:34:12,259
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition that...

1790
02:34:12,425 --> 02:34:16,146
they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

1791
02:34:16,303 --> 02:34:20,103
and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1792
02:34:21,767 --> 02:34:26,022
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1793
02:34:26,605 --> 02:34:31,076
<i>My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.</i>

1794
02:34:31,235 --> 02:34:32,657
<i>Blake, John.</i>

1795
02:34:32,945 --> 02:34:36,199
Nothing here.
Uh, try my legal name.

1796
02:34:39,618 --> 02:34:42,417
You should use your full name.
I like that name.

1797
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:44,457
Robin.
Thanks.

1798
02:34:44,623 --> 02:34:46,796
<i>Why worry about
the stabilization software?</i>

1799
02:34:46,959 --> 02:34:48,961
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.

1800
02:34:49,128 --> 02:34:52,928
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1801
02:34:53,090 --> 02:34:57,220
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

1802
02:34:57,386 --> 02:34:58,979
Check the ID on the patch.

1803
02:35:02,058 --> 02:35:03,651
Bruce Wayne.

1804
02:35:04,518 --> 02:35:06,816
Any news on the missing item?
Not yet.

1805
02:35:06,979 --> 02:35:08,419
They better leave no stone unturned.

1806
02:35:08,564 --> 02:35:11,989
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as lost.
