1
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,500
Long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

2
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,420
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,630
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,370
With all due respect,

5
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,910
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,910
" Yes, of course. "

7
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,110
" As you know, our blockade
is perfectly legal, "

8
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,280
" and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors. "

9
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,410
I'm TC-14
at your service.

10
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,450
This way, please.

11
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,650
We are greatly honored
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,660
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,930
My master will be
with you shortly.

14
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,240
I have a bad feeling
about this.

15
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,370
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,410
It's something...
elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,910
Don't center on
your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,180
Keep your concentration
here and now, where it belongs.

19
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,150
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,250
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,360
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,360
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,230
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,430
These Federation types
are cowards.

25
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,410
The negotiations
will be short.

26
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,810
What?
What did you say?

27
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,880
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,880
I knew it.

29
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,220
They're here
to force a settlement.

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,380
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,430
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,430
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

33
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,430
Send a droid.

34
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,740
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,610
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for
something as trivial as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,300
" What is it? "

37
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,030
This scheme of yours
has failed, Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,730
" The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi. "

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,670
" Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again. "

40
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,540
" This turn of events is unfortunate. "

41
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,740
" We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops. "

42
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,580
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,990
" I will make it legal. "

44
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,420
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,970
" The chancellor should never have brought
them into this. Kill them immediately. "

46
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,370
Yes. Yes, my lord.
Uh, as you wish.

47
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,040
Captain, look!

48
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,510
Shields up!

49
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,880
Sorry.

50
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,520
Dioxis.

51
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,990
" They must be dead by now. "

52
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,030
" Destroy what's left of them. "

53
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,340
Oh! Excuse me.

54
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,410
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

55
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,010
Uh-oh. Blast them.

56
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,320
What is going on down there?

57
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,390
We lost the transmission,
sir.

58
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,890
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

60
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,800
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

61
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,910
I want droidekas
up here at once!

62
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,540
We will not survive this.

63
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,530
Close the blast doors!

64
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,340
That will hold them.

65
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,580
They are still
coming through.

66
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,590
This is impossible!

67
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,890
Where are those droidekas?

68
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,230
Master! Destroyers!

69
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,400
They have shield generators!

70
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,210
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

71
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,910
They're no match
for droidekas.

72
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,490
Sir! They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

73
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,900
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

74
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,330
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

75
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,570
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

76
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,620
Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.

77
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,620
You were right
about one thing, Master.

78
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,210
The negotiations were short.

79
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,790
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

80
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,990
It's Queen Amidala herself.

81
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,800
At last we are
getting results.

82
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,860
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

83
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,100
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

84
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,940
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

85
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,610
I was not aware
of such failure.

86
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,450
" I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now... "

87
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,250
" and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement. "

88
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,690
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

89
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,190
You must be mistaken.

90
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,320
" Beware, Viceroy. "

91
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,130
" The Federation has gone too far this time. "

92
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,290
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

93
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,900
You assume too much.

94
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,910
" We will see. "

95
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,040
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

96
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,120
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

97
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,620
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,900
" Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there? "

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
" How could that be true? "

100
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,640
" I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive. "

101
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,470
" It must... handiwork...
negotiate... ambassadors... "

102
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,240
" - Nobody would... "
- Senator Palpatine.

103
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,250
What's happening?

104
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,250
Check the transmission
generator.

105
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,260
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

106
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,660
The Federation would not
dare go that far.

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,630
The senate would revoke their
trade franchise, and they'd be finished.

108
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,600
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

109
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,930
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

110
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,370
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

111
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,150
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

112
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,620
Our security volunteers will be no match
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

113
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,850
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

114
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:06,560
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

115
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,460
" - Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship, "

116
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,700
" and there is no trace
of the Jedi. "

117
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,600
" They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft. "

118
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,180
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

119
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,150
" Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated. "

120
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,030
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

121
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,120
Get down!

122
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,470
Ay-yee-yee! Wha!

123
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,680
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

124
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,680
Oh, mooie-mooie!
I love you!

125
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,980
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

126
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,890
- I spake.
- The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.

127
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,790
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

128
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,960
Mesa culled JarJar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

129
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,190
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

130
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,200
'Tis demanded
by the gods, it 'tis.

131
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,760
- Oh, no! Whoo!
- Stay down!

132
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,340
You saved my again.

133
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,350
- What's this?
- A local.

134
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,290
- Let's get out of here before more droids show up.
- More?

135
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,520
" More" did you spake?

136
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,500
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

137
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,830
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

138
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,340
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

139
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,610
- Can you take us there?
- Uh, on second thought, no.

140
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,210
- Not really, no.
- No?

141
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,440
'Tis embarrassing,

142
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,520
but, uh, my afraid
my've been banished.

143
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,780
My forgotten.
Da bosses would do terrible tings to me.

144
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,990
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

145
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,090
- You hear that?
- Yah.

146
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,970
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

147
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,630
If they find us,
they will crush us,

148
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,300
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

149
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,370
Oh. Yousa point
is well seen.

150
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,850
This way. Hurry!

151
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,420
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

152
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,430
Ah, my warning you.

153
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,660
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

154
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,100
Oh, don't worry. This hasn't
been our day for warm welcomes.

155
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,110
Ar, Ar, Ar!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

156
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,990
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

157
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,210
So good bein home!

158
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,350
- Oh, me gusa.
- Hata-hata.

159
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,460
Hey, yousa.

160
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,620
- Stopa dare!
- Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

161
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,660
Mesa back!

162
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,700
Noah gain, JarJar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

163
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,470
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

164
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,100
Ohh.

165
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,570
Ay, ay.

166
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,810
How wude.

167
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,890
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk!
Yousa cannot bees hair.

168
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,520
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

169
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,570
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

170
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,300
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk.

171
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,210
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

172
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,250
Day tink day brains so big.

173
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,480
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

174
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,880
Mesa no tink so.

175
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,890
Day not know of USS-en.

176
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,960
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

177
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,460
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

178
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,400
Wesa no carrrre-nn
about da Naboo.

179
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,030
Then speed us on our way.

180
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,670
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

181
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,610
We could use a transport.

182
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,580
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

183
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,740
- Hmm?
- Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

184
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,590
'tis goen through
the planet core.

185
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,590
Now...

186
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,530
go.

187
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,900
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

188
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,060
Master, what's a bongo?

189
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,170
A transport, I hope.

190
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,370
Deysa setten yousa up.

191
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,140
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

192
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,440
Mmm... any help here
would be hot.

193
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,650
Master, we're short on time.

194
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,380
We'll need a navigator
to get us through the planet's core.

195
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,460
This Gungan may be of help.

196
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,620
What is to become
of JarJar Binks here?

197
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,670
Hisen soon to be
pune-ished.

198
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,000
- Ohh.
- I saved his life.

199
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,610
He owes me what you call
a " life-debt."

200
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,610
Your gods demand that his life
belongs to me now.

201
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,080
Binkssssss,

202
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,780
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

203
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,290
Mm, uh-huh.

204
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,690
Begone wit him!

205
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,770
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,000
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,270
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,300
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,670
- Why were you banished, JarJar?
- It's a longo tale-o,

210
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,830
buta small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,840
- You were banished because you were clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,930
Mesa caused mabbe one,
two-y lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,090
Yud-say
boom da gassar,

214
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,000
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,150
Wuh-oh!

216
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,310
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

217
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,260
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

218
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,840
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

219
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,940
" I have the senate bogged down
in procedures. "

220
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,510
" They will have no choice but to accept
your control of the system. "

221
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,360
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

222
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,460
" Queen Amidala is young and naive. "

223
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,020
" You will find controlling her
will not be difficult. "

224
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,040
Yes, my lord.

225
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,340
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

226
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,970
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

227
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,220
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

228
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,120
Ohh, maxi big, da Force.

229
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,060
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

230
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,070
We're losing power.

231
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,830
Ohhh, no!

232
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,010
Wesa dyin' here.

233
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,810
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

234
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,910
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

235
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,960
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

236
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,590
- Power's back.
- Huh?

237
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,750
Aah, monster's back!

238
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,970
Relax.

239
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,970
- Ohh.
- You overdid it.

240
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,720
- Horrible.
- Head for that outcropping.

241
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,820
Oh, boy.

242
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,230
Viceroy, we have
captured the queen.

243
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,040
Ah, victory.

244
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,680
Mmm, dis'n loverly.

245
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,230
How will you explain
this invasion to the senate?

246
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,540
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

247
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,800
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

248
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,400
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

249
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,880
I n time, the suffering of your people will
persuade you to see our point of view.

250
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,960
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,590
- Process them.
- Captain, take them to Camp 4.

252
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,600
Roger, roger.

253
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,540
Whoops!

254
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,110
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

255
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,280
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.
- Get their weapons.

256
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,750
Whoa!
Yousa guys bombad!

257
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,230
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

258
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,300
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

259
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,200
The negotiations
never took place.

260
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,710
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

261
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,350
- They've knocked out all our communications.
- Do you have transports?

262
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,750
In the main hangar.
This way.

263
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,450
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

264
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

265
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,330
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

266
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,100
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

267
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,070
They need her to sign a treaty to make this
invasion legal. They can't afford to kill her.

268
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,240
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

269
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,280
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

270
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,370
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

271
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,880
Our only hope is for
the senate to side with us.

272
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,480
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

273
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,550
Either choice presents
great danger... to us all.

274
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,590
We are brave, Your Highness.

275
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,960
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

276
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,530
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

277
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,360
Be careful, Governor.

278
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,480
We'll need to free
those pilots.

279
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,490
I'll deal with that.

280
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,560
- Halt!
- I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,530
I'm taking these people
to Coruscant.

282
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,890
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,630
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,670
Uh, wait.
You're under arrest.

285
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,380
Come on. Move!

286
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,310
Go!

287
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,510
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,420
Hello, boyos.

289
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,420
There's the blockade.

290
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,540
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,580
How wude!

292
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,230
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,670
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,940
The shields are gone.

295
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,520
The power's back!

296
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,820
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,490
Deflector shields up
at maximum.

298
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,840
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,850
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,150
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,810
Small, out of the way, poor. The Trade
Federation have no presence there.

302
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,790
How can you be sure?

303
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,830
It's controlled by the Hutts.

304
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,760
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

305
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,240
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than if we landed...

306
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,170
on a system controlled
by the Federation,

307
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,600
except that the Hutts aren't looking
for her, which gives us the advantage.

308
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,110
" And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty? "

309
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,880
She has disappeared, my lord.

310
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,190
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

311
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,230
" I want that treaty signed. "

312
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,350
My lord,

313
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,060
it's impossible
to locate the ship.

314
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,360
It's out of our range.

315
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,230
" Not for a Sith. "

316
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,240
" This is my apprentice, "

317
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,240
" Darth Maul. "

318
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,880
" He will find your lost ship. "

319
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,550
This is getting out of hand.

320
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,720
Now there are two of them.

321
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,850
We should not
have made this bargain.

322
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,660
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

323
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,670
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

324
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,110
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

325
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,910
R2-D2, Your Highness.

326
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,150
Thank you, R2-D2.

327
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,120
Padme.

328
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,390
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

329
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,460
It deserves our gratitude.

330
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,760
Continue, Captain.

331
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,270
Your Highness,
with your permission,

332
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,430
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

333
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,910
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

334
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,640
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

335
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,650
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

336
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,820
Hello.

337
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,900
Sorry.
Husa are yousa?

338
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,500
I'm Padme.

339
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,630
Mesa JarJar Binks.

340
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,760
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

341
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,900
Uh-huh.

342
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,600
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

343
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,410
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

344
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,310
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

345
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,820
and grabben dat Jedi,
and pow... mesa here.

346
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,620
Huh. Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

347
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,030
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

348
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,230
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

349
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,290
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

350
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,900
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

351
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,160
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

352
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,100
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

353
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,810
This sun doen murder
to mesa skin.

354
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,410
Wait!

355
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,420
Wait.

356
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,230
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

357
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,160
No more commands from
Her Highness today, Captain.

358
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,360
The spaceport is not
going to be pleasant.

359
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,590
The queen wishes it.

360
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,670
She's curious
about the planet.

361
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,300
This is not a good idea.

362
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,310
Stay close to me.

363
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,930
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,930
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,500
The few spaceports like this one are havens
for those that don't wish to be found.

366
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,410
Like us.

367
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,340
Dissen berry berry bad.

368
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,650
Oh! Icky icky goo!

369
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,860
We'll try one
of the smaller dealers.

370
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,170
Good day to you.

371
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
What do you want?

372
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,880
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

373
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,050
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

374
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,620
Boy, get in here now!

375
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,960
My droid has a readout of what I need.

376
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,960
What took you so long?

377
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,330
I was cleaning the fan switches.

378
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,660
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

379
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:13,430
So... let me take thee
out back, huh?

380
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,440
Ni you'll find what you need.

381
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,910
- Hmm?
- Don't touch anything.

382
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,920
Hmph!

383
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,090
Hmm.

384
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,890
- Are you an angel?
- What?

385
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,730
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

386
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,730
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

387
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,400
They live on the moons
of lego, I think.

388
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,870
You're a funny little boy.

389
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,880
How do you know so much?

390
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,880
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

391
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,320
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

392
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,380
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

393
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,820
How long have you been here?

394
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,890
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

395
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,730
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt,

396
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,570
but she lost us betting
on the Podraces.

397
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,500
You're a slave?

398
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,770
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,610
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

400
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,450
Hmm. Hmm.

401
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,020
Where... Wheres
yousa goin?

402
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,460
Ugh!

403
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,620
- I got ya.
- Hey!

404
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,490
- What?
- Hit the nose.

405
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,090
Oh! Uh.

406
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,700
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

407
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,440
I'm the only one
hereabouts who has one.

408
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,070
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, huh?

409
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,120
Saying of which,

410
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,650
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

411
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,820
I have 20,000
Republic dataries.

412
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,790
Republic credits?

413
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,860
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

414
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,090
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

415
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,830
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

416
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,770
No, they won't!

417
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,070
What, you think you're some kind of
Jedi, waving your hand around like that?

418
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,450
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

419
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,680
No money, no parts, no deal.

420
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:31,320
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

421
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,970
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways if
I wasn't so good at building things.

422
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,630
Oh! Aw! Ooh! Uh!

423
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,230
- Ai, ai! Whoa, ai!
- We're leaving. JarJar.

424
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,610
Whaaa!

425
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,280
I'm glad to have
met you, Anakin.

426
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,220
I was glad to meet you too.

427
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,350
What? Wha... Oh.

428
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,200
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

429
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,240
They seemed nice to me.

430
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,270
Clean the racks.

431
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,600
Then you can go home.

432
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,640
Yippee!

433
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,080
" And you're sure
there's nothing left on board? "

434
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,090
A few containers of supplies.

435
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,250
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

436
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,690
not in the amount
you're talking about.

437
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,230
All right. I'm sure another solution
will present itself.

438
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,260
I'll check back later.

439
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,730
Noah gain!
Noah gain.

440
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,700
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

441
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,270
Wesa be wobbed un crunched!

442
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,570
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

443
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,390
Hmm?
Ah, mooie-mooie.

444
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,230
Hey, hey!
Are you going to pay for that?

445
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,130
Huh? Wanga?

446
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,100
It costs seven wupiupi.

447
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,300
Ah! Chubaa...

448
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,770
Oops.

449
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,240
Is this yours?

450
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,010
Who, mesa?

451
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,040
Ouch! Ouch!

452
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,280
Careful, Sebulba.

453
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,550
He's a big-time outlander.

454
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,100
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

455
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,360
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

456
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,270
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

457
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,400
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

458
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,110
- Hi.
- Hi there.

459
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,050
Your buddy here was about
to be turned into orange goo.

460
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,640
He picked a fight with a Dug, an
especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

461
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,350
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

462
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,450
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

463
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,460
Thanks, my young friend.

464
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,620
But... But...

465
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,070
But mesa doen nutten!

466
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,740
This storm
will slow them down.

467
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,610
Looks pretty bad.

468
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,280
" - Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home. "

469
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,580
We'll be right there.

470
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,690
Here, you'll like these pallies.

471
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,390
- Here.
- Thank you.

472
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,870
Oh, my bones are aching.

473
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,540
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

474
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,550
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

475
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,240
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

476
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,790
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

477
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:00,760
Sandstorms are very,
very dangerous.

478
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,350
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

479
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,240
Mom!

480
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:23,080
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ahh, dissen cozy.

481
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,620
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

482
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,250
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

483
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,790
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

484
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,350
- Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
- Oh, mooie-mooie.

485
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,300
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

486
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,310
He's wonderful.

487
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,280
You really like him?

488
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,320
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

489
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,090
Oh. Oh. Uh...
Where is everybody?

490
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,490
Whoops. Yeah.

491
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,760
Oh, hello.

492
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,200
I am C-3 PO,
human-cyborg relations.

493
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,200
How might I serve you?

494
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,070
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

495
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,740
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

496
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,680
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

497
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,980
Oh, hello. I don't believe we
have been introduced.

498
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,150
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

499
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,320
I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

500
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,190
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

501
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,130
My parts are showing?
My goodness! Oh!

502
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,180
" The death toll is catastrophic. "

503
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,680
" We must bow to their wishes. "

504
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,840
" You must contact me. "

505
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,650
It's a trick. Send no reply.

506
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,280
Send no transmissions of any kind.

507
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,950
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

508
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,030
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

509
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,640
Either way, we're running out of time.

510
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,410
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

511
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,320
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

512
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,320
Move against the Jedi first.

513
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,160
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

514
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,200
to sign the treaty.

515
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,460
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

516
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,040
At last we will have revenge.

517
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,040
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

518
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,540
They will be no match for you.

519
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,340
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

520
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,480
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

521
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,080
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

522
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,630
- Boom!
- How wude!

523
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,170
I can't believe there's
still slavery in the galaxy.

524
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,200
The Republic's antislavery laws...

525
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,640
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

526
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,770
We must survive on our own.

527
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,540
Xcuse me.

528
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,080
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

529
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,780
They have Podracing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

530
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,450
I'm the only human who can do it.

531
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,720
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

532
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,090
Don't do that again.

533
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,130
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

534
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,680
What makes you think that?

535
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,050
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

536
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,050
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

537
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,050
I don't think so.

538
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,280
No one can kill a Jedi.

539
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,190
I wish that were so.

540
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,350
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

541
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,630
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

542
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,100
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

543
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,540
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

544
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,210
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

545
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,340
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

546
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,480
on a very important mission.

547
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,620
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

548
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,360
Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded
here until we can repair it.

549
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,590
I can help.

550
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,470
- I can fix anything.
- I believe you can.

551
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,400
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

552
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,240
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

553
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,870
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

554
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,450
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

555
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,780
Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally.

556
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,760
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

557
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,350
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

558
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,060
- You could enter my pod.
- Anakin!

559
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,230
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

560
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,240
You could make him think it was yours...

561
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,600
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

562
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,910
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

563
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,170
But, Mom, I love it.

564
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,840
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

565
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,290
Anakin.

566
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,190
Your mother's right.

567
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,390
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

568
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,560
No.

569
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:48,240
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

570
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,980
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

571
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,020
We'll find some other way.

572
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,390
No.

573
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,960
There is no other way.

574
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,430
I may not like it, but he can help you.

575
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,090
He was meant to help you.

576
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,580
Are you sure about this?

577
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,350
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

578
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:30,480
The queen will not approve.

579
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,560
The queen doesn't need to know.

580
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,250
Well, I don't approve.

581
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,060
The boy tells me you want to
sponsor him in the race.

582
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:44,200
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?

583
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,470
My ship will be the entry fee.

584
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,670
Oh, not bad!

585
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,770
Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

586
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,180
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

587
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,810
What would the boy ride?

588
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,480
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

589
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,720
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

590
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,230
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

591
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,790
Mmm. That you did, huh.

592
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,770
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

593
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,180
I have acquired a pod in a game
of chance, the fastest ever built.

594
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,410
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

595
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,450
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee,

596
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,460
and I supply the boy.

597
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,460
We split the winnings, um,
50-50, I think, huh?

598
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,190
If it's going to be 50-50, I suggest
you front the cash for the entry.

599
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,360
If we win,

600
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,310
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

601
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,640
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

602
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,470
Either way, you win.

603
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,620
Deal!

604
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,500
Your friend is a foolish one, me thinks.

605
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,980
What if this plan fails, Master?

606
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,850
We could be stuck here a very long time.

607
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,440
" Well, it's too dangerous to call for help, "

608
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,990
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

609
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,060
And...

610
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,990
there's something about this boy.

611
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,200
You should be very proud of your son.

612
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,330
He gives without any thought of reward.

613
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,340
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

614
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:54,380
- He has a...
- He has special powers.

615
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,450
Yes.

616
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,150
He can see things before they happen.

617
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,090
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

618
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,090
It's a Jedi trait.

619
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,030
- He deserves better than a slave's life.
- Why, certainly.

620
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,500
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

621
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,510
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

622
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,580
Who was his father?

623
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,210
There was no father.

624
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:29,020
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

625
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,350
I can't explain what happened.

626
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,830
Can you help him?

627
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,830
I don't know.

628
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,930
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

629
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,080
Hey, hi, Ani.

630
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,710
Hi.

631
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:59,020
Wow, a real astro droid.

632
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,690
- How did you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

633
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,730
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

634
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,560
With this?

635
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,460
You're such a joker, Ani.

636
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,900
- You've been working on that thing for years.
- It's never gonna run.

637
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,100
Come on. Let's go and play ball.

638
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,480
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

639
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,950
Hey, JarJar.

640
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,460
Keep away from those energy binders.

641
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,020
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

642
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,160
Sorry. Okay.

643
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,760
My tongue is fat.

644
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,000
My tongue... Wrench.

645
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,770
Where is da wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

646
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,470
Hey. Uh-oh.

647
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,780
Uh, Ani, I'm stuck. Ani...

648
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,910
You know, I find that JarJar creature
to be a little odd.

649
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,620
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

650
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,820
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

651
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,160
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

652
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,360
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

653
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,630
My... My mouth.

654
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,330
Ani, I'm stuck.

655
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,500
Uh, hey.
My tongue is fat. Ani!

656
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,550
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

657
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,350
Oh. Th... Thank you.

658
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,390
Go.

659
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:49,500
It's working!
It's working!

660
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,650
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

661
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,730
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

662
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,730
Most of them.

663
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,800
Has anyone been to 'em all?

664
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,730
Not likely.

665
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,900
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

666
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,640
- Ani, bedtime!
- Ow!

667
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,510
There we are.
Good as new.

668
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,520
Ani, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

669
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,080
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

670
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,820
Go on. You have
a big day tomorrow.

671
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,830
Sleep well, Ani.

672
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,570
- Obi-Wan?
" - Yes, Master? "

673
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,890
I need an analysis of this blood sample
I'm sending you.

674
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,240
Wait a minute.

675
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,310
I need a midi-chlorian count.

676
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,870
The reading is off the chart.

677
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,880
Over 20,000.

678
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,610
" Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high. "

679
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,590
No Jedi has.

680
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,750
What does that mean?

681
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,760
I'm not sure.

682
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,110
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

683
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,940
Patience, my blue friend. You'll have
your winnings before the suns set.

684
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,280
And we'll be far away from here.

685
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,940
Not if your ship belongs to me, I think,
huh?

686
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:32,920
I warn you, no funny business.

687
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,150
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrong, no.

688
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,760
I have great faith in the boy.

689
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,990
He's a credit to your race,

690
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,370
but, uh, Sebulba there is going to win,
I think.

691
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,240
Oh, no!

692
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,250
Why do you think that?

693
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:58,150
He always wins!

694
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,690
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

695
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,860
- I'll take that bet.
- You what?

696
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,330
I'll wager my new racing pod against, say,

697
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,370
the boy and his mother.

698
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,170
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

699
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,830
The boy, then.

700
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,640
Hmm. Well, uh...

701
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,570
We'll let fate decide, huh?

702
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,120
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

703
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,280
Blue, it's the boy.

704
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,590
Red, uh... his mother.

705
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:51,970
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

706
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,170
So it makes little difference!

707
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,590
Better stop your friend's betting,

708
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,290
or I'll end up owning him too.

709
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,130
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

710
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,300
Good morning.

711
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,410
Oh, my.

712
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,510
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

713
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,640
I can assure you, they will never get
me onto one of those dreadful starships.

714
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:31,150
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

715
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,520
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

716
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:40,220
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

717
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,360
Not even finished?

718
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,960
Kitster's right. I will this time.

719
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,060
Of course you will.

720
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,630
...Podracers.

721
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,610
That's absolutely right.

722
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:23,740
And a big turnout here " from all corners
of the outer rim territories. "

723
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,480
" I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid. "

724
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,450
" I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System. "

725
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,600
" Two-time winner Boles Roor. "

726
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,770
" Sebulba! "

727
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:58,410
And in the front row,
nearside pole position,

728
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,540
" Mawhonic! "

729
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,780
" A hearty hello... "

730
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:07,660
" to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp! "

731
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,530
" Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. "

732
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:13,660
" And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt... "

733
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:18,370
" with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327. "

734
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,010
" And hoping for a big win today, "

735
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,520
" Ody Mandrell, with his
record-setting pit droid team. "

736
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,690
" And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker, "

737
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,290
" A local boy. "

738
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,060
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

739
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,580
Huh?

740
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,180
Pee yousa!

741
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,820
Be safe.

742
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,330
I will, Mom. I promise.

743
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,670
Uh-oh.

744
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,180
You won't walk away from this one,

745
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,550
you slave scum.

746
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,880
Don't count on it, slime ball.

747
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,150
You're bantha fodder!

748
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:41,160
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

749
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,170
- Right.
- Whoa!

750
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,670
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

751
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,540
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

752
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,310
I will.

753
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,610
May the Force be with you.

754
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,550
Jabba the Hutt.

755
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,500
Mmm.

756
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:22,310
Welcome.

757
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:27,440
Begin the race!

758
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,120
" Hey, it looks like
they're clearing the grid. "

759
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,270
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

760
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,770
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

761
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,780
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

762
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,780
You should too.

763
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,320
You assume too much.

764
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,480
" Start your engines. "

765
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,130
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

766
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,010
Oh!

767
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,790
Oh, no! No!

768
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,360
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

769
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:27,050
" Well, it looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also. "

770
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,090
" Come on, Ani! "

771
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,520
" - And there goes Skywalker!
- Go, Ani, go! "

772
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,760
" He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders. "

773
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,530
" Ehh! "

774
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,880
" Haaaa! "

775
01:01:55,410 --> 01:02:00,180
" Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn. "

776
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,120
Doowat macroon!

777
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:16,170
Ooh, there goes
Quadinaros' power coupling.

778
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,770
Cheespa wata!

779
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,470
Ooh!

780
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:25,480
Chubba ni chees Sebulba! Paketa!

781
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,280
Kulkah meeka!

782
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:32,010
Ody Mandrell coona wa wunda dungo!

783
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,360
Whoa!

784
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,130
Oh, no!

785
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,040
Oh.

786
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:54,000
Where is Master Anakin?

787
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,250
Look. Here he comes.

788
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,490
" It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field. "

789
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:05,720
Yay! Yippee!

790
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,800
He has to complete two more circuits?

791
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,840
Oh, dear.

792
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,090
Ah.

793
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,530
Ha!

794
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,970
Arrr!

795
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:26,310
Skywalker's spinning out of control!

796
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,220
Oh, I don't care what universe
you're from. That's gotta hurt!

797
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,020
Here he comes! Owoo!

798
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:40,260
" At the start of the final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead, "

799
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,860
" followed closely by Skywalker! "

800
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,940
Go, Ani!

801
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,790
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

802
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:20,590
Whoa-oa!

803
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,190
Huh?

804
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:38,850
- It's Skywalker!
- Sebulba!

805
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:43,290
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

806
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,090
Did he crash-ed?

807
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:52,090
Wah hota!

808
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:29,010
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

809
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,710
- He's catching Sebulba!
- Inkabunga!

810
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:27,340
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

811
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,780
Wha... Chuba da noya!

812
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:01,180
- That little human being is out of his mind.
- Punda tah punda!

813
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,750
" - They're side by side! "
- Bangu du bangu!

814
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,020
Wa-waaaaah!

815
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,480
Aaah!

816
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,610
Poo doo!

817
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,920
- Yippee!
- Yay!

818
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,620
Ya eeka buta! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

819
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:38,850
I can't believe it.

820
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,860
The crowds are going nuts!

821
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,090
Oh! Ah! Oh! Ah!

822
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:49,640
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah!

823
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,800
Yay, Ani!

824
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:56,170
Mom, I did it! Yeah!

825
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,620
Ohh!

826
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,630
Good going, Ani!

827
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:14,960
We owe you everything, Ani.

828
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:17,470
- Mmm!
- Aww.

829
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,670
It's so wonderful, Ani.

830
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,500
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

831
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,840
I'm so very proud of you.

832
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,880
Aww.

833
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,380
Oy chuba no.

834
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,220
You.

835
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:39,660
You swindled me!

836
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,600
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

837
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,600
I lost everything.

838
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,600
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you'll lose.

839
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,570
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

840
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,010
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

841
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,410
You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.

842
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,120
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

843
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,280
I'm sure they can settle this.

844
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,700
Take him.

845
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,540
Hidoe!

846
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,540
Well, we have all the essential parts
we need.

847
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,740
I'm going back. Some unfinished
business. I won't be long.

848
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:29,340
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

849
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,320
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

850
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,320
Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

851
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,980
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

852
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:40,260
Come on. Hup!

853
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:48,000
Hey. These are yours.

854
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:50,010
Yes!

855
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,440
Mom, we sold the pod!

856
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,940
- Look at all the money we have!
- My goodness!

857
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,920
- But that's so wonderful, Ani.
- And he has been freed.

858
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,780
- What?
- You're no longer a slave.

859
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,660
Did you hear that?

860
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,920
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

861
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,690
You are free.

862
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,770
Will you take him with you?

863
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,170
- Is he to become a Jedi?
- Yes.

864
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,170
Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

865
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,710
Nothing happens by accident.

866
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:27,370
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

867
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,380
Anakin,

868
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:34,090
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge,

869
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:37,130
and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.

870
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:40,350
But I wanna go.
It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

871
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,360
Can I go, Mom?

872
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:45,700
Anakin,

873
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,030
this path has been placed before you.

874
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,630
The choice is yours alone.

875
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,180
I wanna do it.

876
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,980
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

877
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,150
Yippee!

878
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,160
What about Mom?

879
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,200
Is she free too?

880
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,830
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

881
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,840
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

882
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:33,180
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

883
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:36,690
It is time for you to let go.

884
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,920
I don't want things to change.

885
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:41,430
But you can't stop the change...

886
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,590
any more than you can stop
the suns from setting.

887
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,640
Oh, I love you.

888
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,210
Now hurry.

889
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,150
Thank you.

890
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:05,160
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

891
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,820
Will you be all right?

892
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,680
Yeah.

893
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,880
Oh! Oh, my. Oh!

894
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,580
Hello, Master Anakin.

895
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,660
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

896
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,210
and I'm going away in a starship.

897
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:26,250
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

898
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:30,580
However, I should prefer it if
I were a little more completed.

899
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:36,020
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you,
3 PO, give you coverings and all.

900
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:40,080
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.

901
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,100
I'll make sure Mom doesn't
sell you or anything.

902
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,930
Sell me?

903
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,630
Bye.

904
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,640
Oh, my.

905
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:15,030
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

906
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,800
Ani.

907
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,300
Will I ever see you again?

908
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:25,680
What does your heart tell you?

909
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,250
I hope so.

910
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:31,250
Yes.

911
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,250
I guess.

912
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,260
Then we will see each other again.

913
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,200
I will come back and free you, Mom.

914
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,230
I promise.

915
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:55,410
Now, be brave...

916
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:58,210
and don't look back.

917
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,250
Don't look back.

918
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,470
- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

919
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,840
Go! Tell them to take off!

920
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,360
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

921
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,160
Take off.

922
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,030
Over there. Fly low.

923
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,860
Are you all right?

924
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,890
I think so.

925
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,890
What was it?

926
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,400
I'm not sure, but it was
well-trained in the Jedi arts.

927
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,490
My guess is it was after the queen.

928
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,130
What are we gonna do about it?

929
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,980
We shall be patient.

930
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,880
Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

931
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,180
Hi.

932
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,980
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

933
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,100
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving,

934
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,100
and you, Governor, are going to die...

935
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,100
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

936
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,370
This invasion will gain you nothing.

937
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:23,500
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

938
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:25,510
Take him away.

939
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:31,850
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

940
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,350
for these rumored underwater villages.

941
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,860
They will not stay hidden for long.

942
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,630
" The death toll is catastrophic. "

943
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:53,370
" We must bow to their wishes. "

944
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,710
" You must contact me. "

945
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,760
You all right?

946
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:14,490
It's very cold.

947
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,440
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

948
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,950
A little too warm for my taste.

949
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,310
Space is cold.

950
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,580
You seem sad.

951
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,020
The queen is worried.

952
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,560
Her people are suffering, dying.

953
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:42,150
She must convince the senate to intervene,
or...

954
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,900
I'm not sure what'll happen.

955
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,400
I made this for you...

956
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,810
so you'd remember me.

957
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:56,210
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

958
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:59,150
It'll bring you good fortune.

959
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,150
It's beautiful.

960
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:04,650
But I don't need this to remember you by.

961
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:10,690
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

962
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,360
but my caring for you will remain.

963
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:19,200
I care for you, too, only l...

964
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:21,470
Miss your mother.

965
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,160
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

966
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:46,030
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

967
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:49,400
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

968
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,940
It is a great gift to see you alive,
Your Majesty.

969
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,870
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

970
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,610
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

971
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,340
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

972
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,580
Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor
to finally meet you in person.

973
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,280
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

974
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:40,590
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

975
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:44,430
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

976
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,430
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

977
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,440
There is a question of procedure,

978
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,270
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

979
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:55,280
I must speak with
the Jedi Council immediately.

980
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,180
The situation has become
much more complicated.

981
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:05,850
Ani, come on.

982
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,800
The queen's a bein' grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

983
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:23,110
Pitty hot.

984
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:55,310
There is no civility, only politics.

985
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:59,310
The Republic is not what it once was.

986
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:04,680
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

987
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:06,650
There is no interest...

988
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,850
in the common good.

989
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,190
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

990
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:14,230
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

991
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:17,230
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

992
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:21,430
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

993
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:25,440
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

994
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:29,280
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

995
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,940
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

996
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,950
of a stronger supreme chancellor,

997
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,550
one who could control the bureaucrats...

998
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,490
and give us justice.

999
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:43,860
You could call for
a vote of no confidence...

1000
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,900
in Chancellor Valorum.

1001
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,490
He has been our strongest supporter.

1002
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:53,870
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

1003
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:57,310
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

1004
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:00,310
Our people are dying, Senator.

1005
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:04,150
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

1006
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,880
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

1007
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:11,950
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

1008
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,790
That is something I cannot do.

1009
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,770
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

1010
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:29,810
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

1011
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,110
I mpossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

1012
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:38,420
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

1013
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:41,620
Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

1014
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:44,630
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1015
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:47,720
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

1016
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,740
May the Force be with you.

1017
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,280
Master Qui-Gon.

1018
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,780
More to say have you?

1019
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:01,950
With your permission, my master,

1020
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:06,480
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

1021
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:09,620
A vergence, you say?

1022
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,850
Located around a person?

1023
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,860
A boy.

1024
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,900
His cells have the highest concentration
of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

1025
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,770
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1026
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,810
You refer to the prophecy...

1027
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,340
of the one who will bring
balance to the Force.

1028
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:29,310
You believe it's this boy?

1029
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:32,010
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

1030
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,750
Revealed your opinion is.

1031
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:36,880
I request the boy be tested, Master.

1032
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:42,220
Oh? Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

1033
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:45,090
Finding him was the will of the Force.

1034
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,100
I have no doubt of that.

1035
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,800
Bring him before us, then.

1036
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,820
The boy's here to see Padme.

1037
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,830
" Let him in. "

1038
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:17,630
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padme's not here right now.

1039
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,070
Who is it?

1040
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:23,200
Anakin Skywalker to see Padme,
Your Highness.

1041
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,210
I've sent Padme on an errand.

1042
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:30,180
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1043
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,150
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1044
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,150
We will tell her for you.

1045
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,880
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1046
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:41,050
Thank you, Your Highness.

1047
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,100
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1048
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,330
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate,

1049
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:12,830
a tragedy has occurred...

1050
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:16,460
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1051
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:19,590
and has now engulfed our entire planet...

1052
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,700
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

1053
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,040
This is outrageous!

1054
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,700
I object to the senator's statements.

1055
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:30,870
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1056
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,850
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala,

1057
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,950
recently elected ruler of the Naboo,

1058
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,990
who speaks on our behalf.

1059
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,730
Honorable representatives of the Republic,

1060
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:50,960
I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances.

1061
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:54,060
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1062
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,630
I object! There is no proof!

1063
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,650
This is incredible.

1064
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:03,810
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1065
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,120
The Congress of Malastare concurs...

1066
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:09,020
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1067
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:11,530
- A commission must be appointed.
- The point...

1068
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:14,790
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
- Enter the bureaucrat.

1069
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:17,590
The true rulers of the Republic.

1070
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:21,870
And on the payroll of
the Trade Federation, I might add.

1071
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:26,210
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1072
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:30,110
The point is conceded.

1073
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:33,120
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1074
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:35,750
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1075
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:37,760
I will not defer.

1076
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:41,350
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1077
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,490
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1078
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:47,260
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1079
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:52,630
If this body is not capable of action,

1080
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:55,770
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1081
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:00,410
I move for a vote of no confidence...

1082
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,510
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1083
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:11,750
Vote now! Vote now!

1084
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:14,630
Vote now! Vote now!

1085
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:17,460
Vote now! Vote now! Order!

1086
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,500
Now they will elect a new chancellor,

1087
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,510
a strong chancellor,

1088
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:25,510
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1089
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:31,510
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1090
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:34,590
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1091
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:37,590
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1092
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:40,420
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1093
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:46,060
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1094
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:49,290
They will not go along with you this time.

1095
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,340
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1096
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,540
A ship.

1097
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,620
A cup.

1098
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,510
A ship.

1099
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:06,110
A speeder.

1100
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,020
Hmm.

1101
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,560
How feel you?

1102
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,570
Cold, sir.

1103
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,670
Afraid are you?

1104
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:21,700
No, sir.

1105
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:24,430
See through you we can.

1106
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,480
Be mindful of your feelings.

1107
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:29,340
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1108
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:33,510
- I miss her.
- Mmm.

1109
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:36,140
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1110
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,420
What has that got to do with anything?

1111
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,860
Everything.

1112
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,020
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1113
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:47,030
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1114
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:50,500
Hate leads to suffering.

1115
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:59,950
I sense much fear in you.

1116
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:16,260
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?

1117
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,270
I don't know.

1118
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:20,930
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1119
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:25,400
I hope not.

1120
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:28,140
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

1121
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,150
Wesa warriors.

1122
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,680
Wesa got a grand army.

1123
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:37,190
Dat's why you no liken us, mesa tinks.

1124
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:40,120
Your Highness?

1125
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:43,420
Your Highness.

1126
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:46,660
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1127
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:48,830
as supreme chancellor.

1128
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:51,840
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1129
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:56,640
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1130
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,410
Who else has been nominated?

1131
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:02,850
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1132
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:07,890
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1133
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,590
I will be chancellor.

1134
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:14,360
I fear by the time you have
control of the bureaucrats,

1135
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:17,700
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1136
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,700
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

1137
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,330
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1138
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:29,210
Senator, this is your arena.

1139
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,210
I feel I must return to mine.

1140
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:36,750
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1141
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,860
Go back? But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1142
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,860
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1143
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,360
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1144
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,950
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1145
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:48,000
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1146
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,000
Ready my ship.

1147
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,800
Please, Your Majesty,
stay here where it's safe.

1148
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:57,070
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1149
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:01,510
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1150
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,250
The Force is strong with him.

1151
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,300
He is to be trained, then?

1152
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,830
No, he will not be trained.

1153
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,600
No?

1154
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,700
He is too old.

1155
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:30,610
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1156
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:35,350
Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.

1157
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,350
I will train him, then.

1158
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:46,560
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1159
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:49,640
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1160
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:52,100
I mpossible to take on a second.

1161
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,900
The code forbids it.

1162
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:57,410
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1163
01:33:57,510 --> 01:34:01,140
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1164
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,150
He is headstrong,

1165
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:06,620
and he has much to learn of
the living Force, but he is capable.

1166
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,990
There is little more he can learn from me.

1167
01:34:11,330 --> 01:34:13,190
Young Skywalker's fate...

1168
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,130
will be decided later.

1169
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:17,790
Now is not the time for this.

1170
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:20,560
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor,

1171
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,370
and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1172
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:26,740
which will put pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1173
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,140
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1174
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:33,650
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1175
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,820
This is the clue we need...

1176
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,190
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1177
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:42,120
May the Force be with you.

1178
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:58,210
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1179
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:00,210
From your point of view.

1180
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:03,720
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1181
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:06,720
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1182
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,220
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1183
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,230
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1184
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,630
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1185
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,970
You won't be, Ani.

1186
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:28,170
I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful.

1187
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:31,210
Always remember:

1188
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,980
Your focus determines your reality.

1189
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:37,250
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1190
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,190
Master, sir,

1191
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:42,890
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1192
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,520
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1193
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,200
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1194
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,530
that resides within all living cells.

1195
01:35:53,970 --> 01:35:56,880
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1196
01:35:56,980 --> 01:36:00,470
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1197
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:04,520
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1198
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:07,520
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1199
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:10,420
and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1200
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:12,430
They continually speak to us,

1201
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:15,220
telling us the will of the Force.

1202
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:17,460
When you learn to quiet your mind,

1203
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:19,470
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1204
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:21,470
I don't understand.

1205
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:25,060
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1206
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:33,150
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1207
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,180
I welcome your help.

1208
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:38,690
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1209
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:41,950
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1210
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:44,960
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1211
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:47,970
Come on, R2.

1212
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:59,570
" Is the planet secure? "

1213
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,580
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1214
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:06,780
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1215
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:12,790
" Good. I will see to it that in
the senate things stay as they are. "

1216
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:16,800
" I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you. "

1217
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,800
Yes, my lord.

1218
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,800
A Sith here?

1219
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,680
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1220
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:31,180
And those two control the pitch?

1221
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,620
You catch on pretty quick.

1222
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,620
As soon as we land,

1223
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,450
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1224
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:43,320
I agree. I'm not sure what
you wish to accomplish by this.

1225
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:46,330
I will take back what's ours.

1226
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:48,870
There are too few of us, Your Highness.

1227
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:50,870
We have no army.

1228
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:54,530
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1229
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,630
JarJar Binks.

1230
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:59,740
Mesa, Your Highness?

1231
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:02,750
Yes.
I need your help.

1232
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,190
I have one battleship
on my scope.

1233
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,380
It's a droid control ship.

1234
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:14,430
They've probably spotted us.

1235
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:16,520
We haven't much time.

1236
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:32,080
- JarJar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.
- Good.

1237
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,980
Do you think the queen's idea will work?

1238
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:37,990
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1239
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:40,890
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1240
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:45,790
I'm... I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1241
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:49,590
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1242
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:54,870
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1243
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,910
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1244
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:02,250
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1245
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:06,120
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1246
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:21,470
Desa nobody dare.

1247
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:23,730
The Gungan city is deserted.

1248
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:26,400
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1249
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:29,640
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1250
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:32,110
More likely they were wiped out.

1251
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:35,280
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, JarJar?

1252
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:38,820
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1253
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:41,820
Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!

1254
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:03,780
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1255
01:40:08,990 --> 01:40:13,790
Uh, h-heyo dadee,
Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1256
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,990
JarJar Binks.

1257
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:21,200
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1258
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,600
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1259
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:26,830
I come before you in peace.

1260
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:29,840
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1261
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:33,140
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1262
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:36,980
Yousa all bombad.

1263
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:40,680
We have searched you out because
we wish to form an alliance.

1264
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:42,690
Your Honor.

1265
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:47,330
Whosa dis?

1266
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:50,270
- I am Queen Amidala.
- Huh?

1267
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:53,170
This is my decoy,

1268
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:56,640
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1269
01:40:56,740 --> 01:41:01,040
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1270
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:04,080
Although we do not
always agree, Your Honor,

1271
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:07,090
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1272
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:09,090
- Ah.
- The Trade Federation...

1273
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:11,390
has destroyed all that we
have worked so hard to build.

1274
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:14,790
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1275
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:17,130
I ask you to help us.

1276
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:19,960
No, I beg you to help us.

1277
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:22,440
We are your humble servants.

1278
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:28,440
Our fate is in your hands.

1279
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:31,040
Mmm.

1280
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:42,390
Ha!

1281
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:49,960
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1282
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:56,340
Me-e-esa lika dis!

1283
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,270
Maybe...

1284
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,900
wesa...

1285
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:02,910
bein friends.

1286
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:11,020
Yippee! Ya-hoo!

1287
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:13,460
We've sent our patrols.

1288
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,050
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1289
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:19,330
It won't be long, my lord.

1290
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:22,600
" This is an unexpected move for her. "

1291
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:24,730
" It's too aggressive. "

1292
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:27,270
" Lord Maul, be mindful. "

1293
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:29,940
" Let them make the first move. "

1294
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,950
Yes, my master.

1295
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,110
Deysa comin!

1296
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:39,590
All right!

1297
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:43,390
They're here!

1298
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,390
Good. They made it.

1299
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:51,870
Yousa doen grand.

1300
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:55,870
JarJar bring uss-en and da Naboo together.

1301
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:57,870
Ah, no, no, no.

1302
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:00,970
So, wesa make you...

1303
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,110
bombad general.

1304
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,580
General?

1305
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,660
Captain.

1306
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,390
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1307
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:14,430
Almost everyone's in camps.

1308
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:17,760
A few hundred police and guards have
formed an underground resistance movement.

1309
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:20,430
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1310
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:25,200
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought, and much stronger.

1311
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:29,610
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1312
01:43:29,710 --> 01:43:31,610
The battle is a diversion.

1313
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:34,910
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1314
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:37,580
R2.

1315
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:41,280
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1316
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:43,290
Once we get to the main entrance,

1317
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:46,190
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1318
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:49,270
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1319
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:52,630
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1320
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,640
What do you think, MasterJedi?

1321
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,900
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1322
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:59,410
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1323
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:01,950
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1324
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:06,780
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1325
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:10,220
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1326
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,450
We have a plan which
should immobilize the droid army.

1327
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,460
We will send what pilots we have...

1328
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,590
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1329
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:21,790
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1330
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:24,840
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1331
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:26,840
There's an even bigger danger.

1332
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,840
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1333
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:31,170
he will return with another droid army.

1334
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,510
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1335
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:36,740
Everything depends on it.

1336
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,450
" She is more foolish than I thought. "

1337
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,500
We are sending all troops to meet
this army assembling near the swamp.

1338
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,260
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1339
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,930
" This will work to our advantage. "

1340
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:57,870
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1341
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:00,380
" Wipe them out. "

1342
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,980
" All of them. "

1343
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,750
Halt!

1344
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,950
Starting up the shield.

1345
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,680
Open fire.

1346
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:32,010
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1347
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:34,050
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1348
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:52,090
Roger. Roger.

1349
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:03,210
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1350
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:05,810
This is too close.

1351
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:12,460
Ani, find cover.

1352
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:16,590
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1353
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,710
Aah!

1354
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:44,930
Aah!

1355
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,760
- Fighters straight ahead.
- Roger, Bravo Leader.

1356
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:19,090
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1357
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:28,840
Cease fire.

1358
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:38,780
Steady. Steady.

1359
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,120
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1360
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,580
Ouch time.

1361
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:50,030
Fire!

1362
01:49:50,130 --> 01:49:52,260
Whoa-ohh!

1363
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:04,980
Aah! Whoa!

1364
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:12,910
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1365
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:16,430
Red group! Blue group!
Everybody, this way!

1366
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:18,520
Hey, wait for me!

1367
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:21,030
Stay where you are. You'll be safe there.

1368
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:23,540
- But l...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1369
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:38,580
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1370
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,710
We gotta do something, R2.

1371
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,470
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1372
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:32,980
Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one.

1373
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,350
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1374
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:36,440
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1375
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:40,150
Yeah!

1376
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:47,520
Let's go!

1377
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:49,860
It's on automatic pilot.

1378
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:02,240
Try to override it.

1379
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:02,810
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1380
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,790
Look! There they are.

1381
01:53:10,890 --> 01:53:13,260
That's where the autopilot's taking us.

1382
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:27,000
Huh? Waaah! Aah! Aah!

1383
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:29,010
Aah!

1384
01:53:29,110 --> 01:53:32,940
Aaah! Hmm! Dumb droid. Take that!

1385
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:36,280
Get off! Get off!.. Get off! Get off!

1386
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,320
Ooh! Ooh! Mooie!

1387
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:40,720
Whoo-hoo! Aah!

1388
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:48,690
The deflector shield is too strong.

1389
01:53:57,070 --> 01:53:59,340
This is tense!

1390
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:03,680
Whoa! R2, get us off this autopilot.

1391
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,980
It's gonna get us both killed.

1392
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:10,080
You did it, R2!

1393
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:11,850
Okay, let's go left.

1394
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,730
Go back?

1395
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:22,130
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1396
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,510
I'll try spinning. That's a good trick.

1397
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:33,580
Whoa!

1398
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:39,710
I know we're in trouble. J ust hang on.

1399
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:48,550
Go!

1400
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,100
Ascension guns!

1401
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,870
Retreat! Retreat!

1402
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:05,550
Dis is nutsen.

1403
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:07,620
Hyah!

1404
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:10,750
O-O-Ohh!

1405
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:17,430
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1406
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:20,190
Ohh! Ohh!

1407
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,970
Uh-oh! Aaah!

1408
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:38,050
Hey! Hey!

1409
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:41,750
Give me a lift! Aaah! Oh!

1410
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:44,920
Aaah!

1411
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:47,720
Ohh!

1412
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:49,460
JarJar, usen da booma!

1413
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:51,500
What? Mesa no have a booma!

1414
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,570
Here. Taken dis one.

1415
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:56,730
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

1416
01:57:57,940 --> 01:57:59,570
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1417
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:02,670
Whoa-ohh!

1418
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:04,680
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1419
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:06,270
Aaah!

1420
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:08,610
Help me!

1421
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:13,180
JarJar! Jump, JarJar, jump!

1422
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:26,130
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1423
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:41,180
We're hit, R2! Aah!

1424
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:48,490
Aaah!

1425
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,400
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1426
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:06,140
Everything's overheated.

1427
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:09,580
Oops. This is not good.

1428
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:59,040
No!

1429
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:24,190
No giben up, General JarJar.

1430
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,200
Mesa tink of something.

1431
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:28,770
- Hands up.
- My give up.

1432
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,780
My give up.

1433
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:42,580
Your little insurrection is at an end,
Your Highness.

1434
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:46,590
Time for you to sign the treaty and end
this pointless debate in the senate.

1435
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:48,490
Viceroy!

1436
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,530
Your occupation here has ended.

1437
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:55,430
After her. This one's a decoy.

1438
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:04,610
Captain!

1439
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:14,820
Jam the doors.

1440
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:21,190
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1441
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:25,730
Yes! We have power.

1442
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,310
Shields up.

1443
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:31,800
Take this!

1444
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:35,610
And this!

1445
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:37,620
Whoa!

1446
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:44,090
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1447
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:47,390
- There seems to be a problem with the main reactor.
- Impossible!

1448
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,400
Nothing can get through our shield.

1449
02:02:50,670 --> 02:02:53,400
Let's get outta here.

1450
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:03,170
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1451
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:07,740
We didn't hit it.

1452
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:14,380
Now, this is Podracing.

1453
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:18,260
- Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!
- Whoo!

1454
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:24,290
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1455
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,690
Hee-hee!

1456
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:39,080
What the...

1457
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:41,450
Was'n they doing?

1458
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:45,120
The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

1459
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:49,230
They all broke-ed.

1460
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:41,020
No, it... it's too late.

1461
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:43,450
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1462
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:46,590
Promise...

1463
02:04:46,690 --> 02:04:48,920
Promise me you will train the boy.

1464
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:50,930
Yes, Master.

1465
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,590
He is the chosen one.

1466
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:00,970
He... will bring balance.

1467
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:04,080
Train him.

1468
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:32,940
Now, Viceroy,

1469
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:36,450
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1470
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:41,480
I think you can kiss your
trade franchise good-bye.

1471
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:58,730
We are indebted to you for
your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1472
02:05:58,870 --> 02:06:00,770
And you, young Skywalker.

1473
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,840
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1474
02:06:11,390 --> 02:06:13,980
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1475
02:06:14,090 --> 02:06:17,530
Your boldness has saved
our people, Your Majesty.

1476
02:06:17,630 --> 02:06:20,030
It's you who should be congratulated.

1477
02:06:20,130 --> 02:06:24,030
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1478
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:33,500
Confer on you the level of
Jedi knight the council does.

1479
02:06:33,650 --> 02:06:38,380
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1480
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,380
I do not.

1481
02:06:40,490 --> 02:06:42,550
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1482
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:47,930
The chosen one the boy may be.

1483
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:49,930
Nevertheless,

1484
02:06:50,030 --> 02:06:52,930
grave danger I fear in his training.

1485
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:56,560
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1486
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:58,570
I will train Anakin.

1487
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:01,040
Ohh!

1488
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:04,040
Without the approval of the council,
if I must.

1489
02:07:04,150 --> 02:07:06,550
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.

1490
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:08,580
Need that you do not.

1491
02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:13,950
Agree with you the council does.

1492
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:18,360
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1493
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:47,960
What will happen to me now?

1494
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:51,120
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1495
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:54,630
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1496
02:08:03,450 --> 02:08:06,470
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1497
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:10,020
Mmm. Always two there are.

1498
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:13,210
No more, no less.

1499
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,090
A master and an apprentice.

1500
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:18,130
But which was destroyed?

1501
02:08:18,230 --> 02:08:21,160
The master or the apprentice?

1502
02:08:45,790 --> 02:08:47,850
Hello, everybody!

1503
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:36,450
Peace!

1504
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:39,380
Ya-hoo!
