- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,859
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

308
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,863
- This is the end of the chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

309
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,406
Is that a serious offer?

310
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,908
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

311
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,911
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

312
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,913
- Okay.
- Done.

313
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:28,126
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

314
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,628
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

315
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,548
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

316
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,467
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

317
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,095
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

318
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,431
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

319
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,893
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

320
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,105
Whatever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

321
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,650
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

322
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,569
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

323
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,114
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

324
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,450
Let me point out just two items:

325
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,787
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

326
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,875
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

327
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,377
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

328
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,880
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

329
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,174
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

330
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,551
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

331
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,511
I have my orders.

332
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,139
I see. Gestapo spank.

333
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,142
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

334
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,687
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

335
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,981
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

336
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,317
- I am--
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

337
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,694
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

338
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,707
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

339
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,751
I have already given him the best...

340
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,504
...knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

341
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,716
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

342
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,760
Yes, sir.

343
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,808
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

344
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,857
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

345
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,026
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

346
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,864
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

347
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,701
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

348
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,578
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir.

349
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,082
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

351

I expected no less, captain.

00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,381
Monsieur Ugarte.

353
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,259
Oh. Yes?

354
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,803
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

355

Rick! Rick, help me!

- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,936
Excellent, captain.

363

When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

Just sit down and have a good time.

00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,332
RENAULT:
Rick.

370
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:58,086
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

371
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,129
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

372
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,465
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

373
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,134
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

374
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,306
We are very honored tonight.

375
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:14,644
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

376
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,772
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

377
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,566
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

378
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,778
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

379
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,531
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

380
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,325
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

381
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,954
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

382
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,790
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

383
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,502
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

384
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,421
There seems to be no secret
about that.

385
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,047
Are you one of those people...

386
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,008
...who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

387
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,177
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

388
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,263
Can you imagine us in London?

389
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,890
When you get there, ask me.

390
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,517
Diplomatist.

391
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:55,852
How about New York?

392
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,104
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

393
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,273
...that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

394
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,482
Uh-huh.

395
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,329
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

396
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,737
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

397
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,157
And that takes in the field
of women too.

398
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,534
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

399
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,619
We have a complete dossier on you.

400
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,625
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

401
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,379
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

402
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,131
And also we know why you left Paris.

403
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,300
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

404
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,718
Are my eyes really brown?

405
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,096
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

406
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,515
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

407
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,685
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

408
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:41,898
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

409
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,860
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

410
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,530
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

411
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,700
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

412
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,452
...until the day we marched in.

413
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:58,956
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

414
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,834
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

415
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,254
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

416
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:09,342
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

417
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,970
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

418
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,014
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

419
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,184
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

420
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:19,894
Perhaps.

421
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:24,982
Yes, monsieur?

422
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,028
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

423
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,932
Two Cointreaux, please.

424
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,436
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

425
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:05,731
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

426
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,818
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

427
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:12,196
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

428
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,750
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

429
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:16,909
Well?

430
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:21,414
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

431
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,125
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

432
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,793
The ring is quite unique.

433
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,591
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

434
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,175
What is your name?

435
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,678
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

436
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,054
Victor.

437
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,432
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

438
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,184
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

439
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,478
BERGER: Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

440
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,355
I'm sorry, it is.

441
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,359
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

442
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,570
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

443
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:53,904
Yes, what is it you want?

444
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,199
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

445
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,119
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

446
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,747
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

447
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,459
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

448
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,544
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

449
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,215
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

450
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,176
That was a gross understatement.

451
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,677
You're very kind.

452
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,388
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

453
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,850
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

454
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,853
- Captain, please.
- It's a game we play.

455
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,106
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

456
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,777
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

457
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,904

00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,222
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

767
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:21,728
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

768
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:27,775
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

769
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,068
Tell me...

770
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,113
...who was it you left me for?

771
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,116
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

772
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,161
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

773
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,801
[DOOR CLOSES]

774
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:07,065
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

775
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,609
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

776
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:12,820
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

777
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,114
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

778
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,867
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

779
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:20,119
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

780
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:24,207
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

781
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:27,293
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

782
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,297
It may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

783
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:39,013
There is nothing we can do.

784
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,642
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

785
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:43,851
I slept very well.

786
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,646
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

787
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,191
- May we proceed?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

788
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,276
Thank you.

789
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:57,365
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

790
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:59,867
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

791
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,869
You have reached Casablanca.

792
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,789
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

793
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,125
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

794
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,044
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

795
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,922
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

796
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,424
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

797
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:17,718
Well, perhaps I shall like it
in Casablanca.

798
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,012
STRASSER:
And mademoiselle?

799
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:23,724
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

800
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,811
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

801
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,647
You may be
in Casablanca indefinitely.

802
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,732
Or you may leave
for Lisbon tomorrow.

803
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,110
- On one condition.
- And that is?

804
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:37,572
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

805
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,115
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

806
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,576
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

807
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:44,370
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

808
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,165
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

809
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,083
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

810
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,044
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

811
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,922
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

812
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,885
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

813
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,930
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

814
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:06,058
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

815
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,853
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

816
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,689
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

817
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:13,441
What if you murdered all of us?

818
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:17,945
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

819
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,448
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

820
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:24,160
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

821
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:25,953
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

822
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,664
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

823
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,374
But there is one exception.

824
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,169
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

825
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:36,255
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

826
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,966
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

827
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,676
This is still unoccupied France.

828
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,971
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

829
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,849
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

830
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:51,145
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

831
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:55,650
- Yes?
- I believe you have a message for him?

832
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,069
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

833
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,656
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

834
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,658
Signor Ugarte is dead.

835
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,791
I'm making out the report now.

836
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,543
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

837
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,088
...or died trying to escape.

838
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,425
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

839
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:23,135
Good day.

840
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:30,142
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

841
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,352
Excuse me, captain.

842
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,563
Another visa problem has come up.

843
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,942
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

844
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,662
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

845
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:52,581
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

846
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,959
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

847
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,753
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

848
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,047
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

849
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,383
MAN:
Thanks.

850
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,604
FERRARI:
Don't be too downhearted.

851
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,898
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

852
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,400
Thank you very much, signor.

853
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,986
RICK: Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

854
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:24,322
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

855
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,574
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

856
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,034
I never drink in the morning.

857
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,953
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

858
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,080
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

859
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,582
Here, sit down.

860
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,418
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

861
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,211
Bourbon.

862
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,422
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

863
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:44,759
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

864
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,970
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

865
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:50,181
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

866
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:51,640
Practically no one.

867
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,101
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

868
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,437
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

869
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,939
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

870
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,649
I'll handle the entire transaction.

871
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:03,527
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

872
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,237
And the carrying charges?

873
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:08,157
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

874
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,285
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

875
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,995
I'll tell him when he comes in.

876
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,790
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

877
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:19,293
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

878
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:28,010
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

879
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:31,514
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

880
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,641
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

881
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,229
LASZLO:
Morning.

882
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:40,981
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

883
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:48,280
MAN: You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

884
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,782
Only 700 francs.

885
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,160
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

886
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:56,455
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

887
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:59,166
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

888
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,962
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

889
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:04,171
Doesn't matter.

890
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:08,300
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

891
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:11,512
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

892
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,305
I have some tablecloths, napkins--

893
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:16,183
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

894
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,979
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

895
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,188
Yes.

896
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,691
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

897
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,484
I don't think I will, Rick.

898
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,195
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

899
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,947
I think I'm entitled to know.

900
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,324
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

901
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,203
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

902
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,956
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

903
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,544
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

904
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,716
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

905
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:50,176
If we leave it that way...

906
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,721
...maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

907
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,306
Not last night.

908
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:59,226
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

909
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,271
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

910
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:04,148
You can believe that if you want to.

911
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,067
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

912
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,069
Above a saloon, it's true...

913
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,696
...but walk up a flight...

914
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,573
...I'll be expecting you.

915
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,453
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

916
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,371

No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

921
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:41,435
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

922
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:44,355
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

923
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,190
...I am influential and respected.

924
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:49,777
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

925
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,779
You, however, are a different matter.

926
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:56,617
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

927
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,162
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

928
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:03,624
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while--

929

Might as well be frank, monsieur.

930
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:09,255
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

We are only interested in two visas.

- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

933
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,720
You two will want to discuss this.

934
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,847
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

935

No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

936
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:28,065
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

937
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,109
But if the situation were different...

938
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:32,820
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

939
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,321
...would you take it?

940
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,615
Yes, I would.

941
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:38,993
Yes, I see.

942
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,081
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

943
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,417
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

944
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:50,296
...and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

I meant to,
but something always held me up.

I love you very much, Ilsa.

Your secret will be safe with me.

Not more than 50 francs.

We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

951

For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

Well, good luck, but be careful.

953
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,202
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

954
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,581
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

955
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,500
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

956
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,544
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

957
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:33,881
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

958
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:35,090
Yes, something.

959
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:38,469
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

960
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,638
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

961
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,891
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

Rick?

963
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:48,979
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

Louis, are you Pro-Vichy

01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,847
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1223
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,851
No, Victor, there isn't.

1224
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:34,025
I love you very much, my dear.

1225
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,861
Yes.

1226
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:39,364
Yes, I know.

1227
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:42,617
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1228
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:45,495
You don't even have to say it.

1229
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:47,413
I'll believe.

1230
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,875
Good night, dear.

1231
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,212
Good night.

1232
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,930
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1233
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,603
Be careful.

1234
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,773
Of course I'll be careful.

1235
01:18:57,108 --> 01:19:00,319
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1236
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,280
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1237
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,240
Two weeks, maybe three.

1238
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,659
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1239
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:09,120
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1240
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:10,663
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1241
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:14,167
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1242
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:17,587
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1243
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,882
- Then I am going to the meeting--
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1244
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,258
I won't.

1245
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:24,510
Good night.

1246
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:27,221
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1247
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:47,283
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1248
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:50,787
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1249
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,205
Well, won't you sit down?

1250
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:56,292
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1251
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:59,754
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1252
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,673
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1253
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,468
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1254
01:20:05,635 --> 01:20:08,221
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1255
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,515
I know how you feel about me...

1256
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:13,434
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1257
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:16,062
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1258
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:18,231
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1259
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,732
It was your cause too.

1260
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:22,401
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1261
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,571
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1262
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,782
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1263
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,163
Richard.

1264
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:37,917
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you--

1265
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:41,003
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1266
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:44,632
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth--

1267
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:46,884
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1268
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:50,096
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1269
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:57,061
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1270
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,981
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1271
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,816
One woman has hurt you...

1272
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:04,735
...and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1273
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,446
You're a coward and a weakling.

1274
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:13,703
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1275
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,748
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1276
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:20,626
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1277
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:21,836
What of it?

1278
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:24,672
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1279
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,347
Now, if you'll--

1280
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,018
All right.

1281
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,228
I tried to reason with you.

1282
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,647
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1283
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:45,151
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1284
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:48,613
Put them on the table.

1285
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:51,490
No.

1286
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:54,702
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1287
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:59,999
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1288
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,419
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1289
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:09,550
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1290
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:16,349
Richard...

1291
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,893
...I tried to stay away.

1292
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,938
I thought I would never see you again.

1293
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:25,524
That you were out of my life.

1294
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,838
The day you left Paris...

1295
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,384
...if you knew what I went through.

1296
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:55,721
If you knew how much I loved you.

1297
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:59,558
How much I still love you.

1298
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:14,490
And then?

1299
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:20,871
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1300
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:24,583
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1301
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,460
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1302
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:29,255
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1303
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:32,758
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1304
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,260
Then it came.

1305
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:36,637
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1306
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,433
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1307
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:43,269
Then I met you.

1308
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,939
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1309
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:50,234
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1310
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:52,945
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1311
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:56,365
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1312
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:59,869
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1313
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:01,579
...and for those working with us.

1314
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,540
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1315
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:08,127
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1316
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:10,713
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1317
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,008
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1318
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,343
He was sick. He needed me.

1319
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:20,556
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1320
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:24,685
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1321
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,480
Well...

1322
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,482
...well, you know the rest.

1323
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:35,488
Well, it's still a story
without an ending.

1324
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:36,822
What about now?

1325
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,033
Now?

1326
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:41,368
I don't know.

1327
01:24:42,036 --> 01:24:45,081
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1328
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,333
And Laszlo?

1329
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,961
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1330
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:54,465
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1331
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,133
All except one.

1332
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,011
He won't have you.

1333
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,932
I can't fight it anymore.

1334
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,019
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1335
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:13,067
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1336
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:15,319
You have to think for both of us.

1337
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,696
For all of us.

1338
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,994
All right. I will.

1339
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:29,834
Here's looking at you, kid.

1340
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:34,713
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1341
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:49,186
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1342
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,313
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1343
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,523
Come inside.

1344
01:25:56,819 --> 01:26:01,699
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1345
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,701
LASZLO:
Thank you.

1346
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:23,304
RICK:
Carl, what happened?

1347
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,472
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1348
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,099
We escaped at the last moment.

1349
01:26:27,308 --> 01:26:29,602
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1350
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:33,105
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1351
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:35,983
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1352
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,944
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1353
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:50,122
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1354
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:04,220
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1355
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,138
This might come in handy.

1356
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:07,473
Thank you.

1357
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:10,309
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1358
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:15,064
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1359
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:17,149
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1360
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,277
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1361
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:21,987
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1362
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,615
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1363
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:27,034
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1364
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:29,370
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1365
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,747
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

1366
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:34,166
...of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1367
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,503
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1368
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:40,547
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1369
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:44,009
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1370
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,761
...and that you'll never succeed.

1371
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:48,180
You seem to know
all about my destiny.

1372
01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:52,559
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1374

It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1375
01:27:57,273 --> 01:28:00,192
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

between you and Ilsa.

You won't give me the letters of transit.

...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

You might as well let him go now.

you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

Don't bother to deny it.

And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

but you are effective. I get the point.

Yes, I have the letters.

- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1418
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,655
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1419
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:14,034
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1420

We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1421

...but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1422

...in spite of their legal rights.

1423

What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1424
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:23,502
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1425
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:26,338
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1428
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:35,180
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

to pick up the letters...

1434

...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

You get him, and we get away.

that last will be just a minor annoyance.

If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

You think of everything, don't you?

1528

And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1529
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:20,942
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

What about you?

No. What has happened?
Last night you said--

01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:29,117
Last night
we said a great many things.

You said
I was to do the thinking for us.

I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1536

You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

- Richard, no--
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1539
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:45,383
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1540
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,844
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1541
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:51,431
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

But what about us?

We'll always have Paris.

until you came to Casablanca.

You didn't know she was at my place

She came there for the letters of transit.

Yes.

Nothing worked.

She did her best to convince me
