2
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,033
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was our aunt's.</font></b>

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,410
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We used to come here as kids.</font></b>

4

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Order uses it now as a safe house.</font></b>

5
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,050
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">What's left of us, at least.</font></b>

6

7
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,844
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to talk to the goblin.</font></b>

8

9
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,490
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Alive.</font></b>

10

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You probably don't remember--</font></b>

11
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,292
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That I showed you to your vault

12
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,000
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even amongst goblins you're famous,
Harry Potter.</font></b>

13
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,471
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You buried the elf.</font></b>

14
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,006
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font></b>

15
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,891
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And brought me here.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...a very unusual wizard.</font></b>

18
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,613
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you come by this sword?</font></b>

19
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,491
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.</font></b>

20
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,251
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?</font></b>

21
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,499
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.</font></b>

22
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,389
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The sword presented itself to us
in a moment of need.</font></b>

23
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,308
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't steal it.</font></b>

24
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,728
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...</font></b>

25
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,517
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...but it is a fake.</font></b>

26
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,356
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was placed there this summer.</font></b>

27
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,863
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.</font></b>

28
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,902
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a goblin would recognize
that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.</font></b>

29
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,785
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is the acquaintance?</font></b>

30
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,415
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A Hogwarts professor.
As I understand it, he's now headmaster.</font></b>

31
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,247
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Snape?</font></b>

32
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,958
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault?</font></b>

33
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,710
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font></b>

34
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,470
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.</font></b>

35
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,382
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?</font></b>

36
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,264
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps.</font></b>

37
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,063
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.</font></b>

38
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,897
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is impossible.</font></b>

39
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,985
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Alone, yes. But with you, no.</font></b>

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,571
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why should I help you?</font></b>

41
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,490
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have gold. Lots of it.</font></b>

42
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,706
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?</font></b>

43
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,417
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That</font></b>

44
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,089
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That is my price.</font></b>

45
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,814
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you thinking
there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?</font></b>

46
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,480
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">She was terrified when she
thought we'd been in there.</font></b>

47
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,523
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.</font></b>

48
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,614
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
another piece of his soul.</font></b>

49
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,746
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.</font></b>

50
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,702
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And what happens when we find it?</font></b>

51
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,290
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How are we supposed to destroy it
now you've given the sword to Griphook?</font></b>

52
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,499
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still working on that part.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's weak.</font></b>

54
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,143
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font></b>

55
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,975
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you
a few questions.</font></b>

56
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,940
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything, my boy, anything.</font></b>

57
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,489
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you mind identifying this wand?</font></b>

58
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,275
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to know if it's safe to use.</font></b>

59
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,995
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Walnut.</font></b>

60
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,461
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dragon heartstring.</font></b>

61
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,877
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">12 and 3-quarter inches.</font></b>

62
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,675
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unyie--</font></b>

63
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,426
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Unyielding.</font></b>

64
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,760
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.</font></b>

65
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,726
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Treat it carefully.</font></b>

66
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,724
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And this?</font></b>

67
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,024
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hawthorn.</font></b>

68
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,941
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And unicorn hair.</font></b>

69
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,783
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">10 inches. Reasonably pliant.</font></b>

70
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,875
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.</font></b>

71
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,082
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Was? Is it not still?</font></b>

72
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,378
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, perhaps not, if you won it from him.</font></b>

73
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,385
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I sense its allegiance has changed.</font></b>

74
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,982
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You talk about wands
as if they have feelings...</font></b>

75
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,192
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...can think.</font></b>

76
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,037
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.</font></b>

77
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,543
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That much has always been clear
to those of us who have studied wandlore.</font></b>

78
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,089
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?</font></b>

79
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,260
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is rumored there are three:</font></b>

80
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,102
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Elder Wand...</font></b>

81
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:36,101
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...the Cloak of Invisibility
to hide you from your enemies...</font></b>

82
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:42,114
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...and the Resurrection Stone
to bring back loved ones from the dead.</font></b>

83
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:47,278
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Together, they make one
the master of death.</font></b>

84
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:53,542
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But few truly believe
that such objects exist.</font></b>

85
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,373
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you?</font></b>

86
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,125
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe they exist, sir?</font></b>

87
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:08,262
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.</font></b>

88
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,932
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lying.</font></b>

89
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,395
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You know one exists.</font></b>

90
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,396
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You told him about it.</font></b>

91
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:21,107
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You told him about the Elder Wand
and where he could go looking for it.</font></b>

92
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,692
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He tortured me.</font></b>

93
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,196
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides...</font></b>

94
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,908
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...I only conveyed rumors.</font></b>

95
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,206
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There's ...</font></b>

96
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,586
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no telling whether he will find it.</font></b>

97
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,504
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He has found it, sir.</font></b>

98
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,182
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll let you rest.</font></b>

99
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,100
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's after you, Mr. Potter.</font></b>

100
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,528
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...</font></b>

101
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,031
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...I'm afraid...</font></b>

102
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,534
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">...you really don't stand a chance.</font></b>

103
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,334
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him

104
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,759
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure that's hers?</font></b>

105
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,049

106
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,720
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well?</font></b>

107
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,647
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I look?</font></b>

108
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,732
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hideous.</font></b>

109
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,646
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You can give that to Hermione to hold,

110
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,670
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're relying on you.</font></b>

111
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,883
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get us past the guards

112
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,605
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Madam Lestrange.</font></b>

115

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Easy.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand?</font></b>
