1
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:16,745
Thank you very much, sir.

2
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,997
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

3
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,959
We did it, Pete. We did it.

4
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,755
For a moment, we had our doubts.

5
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:30,258
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case...

6
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,135
murder in the first degree.

7
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:37,182
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

8
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:39,017
You've listened to the testimony.

9
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:42,020
You've had the law read to you and
interpreted as it applies in this case.

10
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:46,124
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

11
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:50,587
One man is dead. Another
man's life is at stake.

12
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,366
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused...

13
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,368
a reasonable doubt...

14
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,246
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

15
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,207
Now if, however, there's
no reasonable doubt...

16
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:06,185
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

17
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:11,424
However you decide, your
verdict must be unanimous.

18
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:14,886
In the event that you find
the accused guilty...

19
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:18,306
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

20
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:21,601
The death sentence is
mandatory in this case.

21
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:25,413
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

22
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,459
The alternate jurors are excused.

23
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,467
The jury will now retire.

24
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,462
Try this one.
See if I can get it...

25
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,548
It's a muggy day.

26
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:46,162
Hey. Oh, oh.

27
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,301
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

28
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,470
This thing is...

29
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,197
...move it.

30
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:07,976
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

31
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:09,410
That's it.

32
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,651
- You know something?
- Yeah?

33
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,486
I called the weather
bureau this morning.

34
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,488
This is gonna be the
hottest day of the year.

35
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,156
Could be.

36
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:24,158
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

37
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:27,578
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh... That one, yeah.

38
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,080
Thank you very much.

39
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:31,916
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

40
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,836
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

41
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,188
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

42
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,893
Good morning.

43
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:52,437
I never knew they locked the door.

44
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:54,705
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

45
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,209
I don't know. It just
never occurred to me.

46
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,612
What's that for?

47
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,573
Oh, I thought we might
want to vote by ballot.

48
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:06,325
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

49
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,346
Just in case, you know.

50
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,960
- How'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

51
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:17,712
It was pretty interesting.

52
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:19,756
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

53
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:22,425
I mean, I've never
been on a jury before.

54
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:25,236
No? I've sat on many juries.

55
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:29,307
What gets me is the way those
lawyers talk and talk and talk...

56
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,559
even when it's an open-and-shut
case like this one.

57
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,352
Did you ever hear so
much talk about nothin'?

58
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:35,313
Well, I guess they're entitled.

59
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:37,874
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

60
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:43,154
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

61
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:45,323
It would save us a lot
of time and money.

62
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:46,949
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

63
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,660
Yeah, let's get goin', huh? We
probably all got things to do here.

64
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:51,434
I figured we'd start out
with a five-minute break.

65
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,789
There's one gentleman
in the bathroom.

66
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,831
Mr. Foreman.

67
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:56,709
- Are, uh... Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

68
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,561
I, uh... Well, I guess so.

69
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,009
Uh, you're in my seat.

70
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,111
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

71
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,407
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

72
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:17,480
What did you think of the case?

73
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,607
I mean, it had a lot
of interest for me.

74
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:22,835
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

75
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:26,155
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

76
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,199
I figured us for an
assault or burglary.

77
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,535
Boy, they can be the dullest.

78
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:33,412
Hey.

79
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:35,081
That the Woolworth Building?

80
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:37,083
That's right.

81
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,751
Isn't that funny?

82
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:41,212
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

83
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:43,381
If you had to
sort out all that junk...

84
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,550
Like that thing with the movies.

85
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:48,636
Yeah. You can say that again. And what
about that business with the knife?

86
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,597
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

87
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,142
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

88
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,686
Yeah, I guess so.

89
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:58,479
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

90
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:01,607
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

91
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,901
These hot-weather
colds can kill you.

92
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,404
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

93
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:10,032
I sure do. I just got over one.

94
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,306
Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman,
let's go here, huh?

95
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:14,579
Well, that guy's still
in the bathroom.

96
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,498
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a
chance to see a paper this morning.

97
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,666
Hmm?

98
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,169
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

99
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,963
You got a seat on the Exchange?

100
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:25,798
I'm a broker.

101
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:30,261
I run a messenger service...
the Beck and Call Company.

102
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:32,471
The name is my wife's idea.

103
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:36,184
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

104
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:39,437
Okay, men, let's
take our seats, huh?

105
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,442
Yeah, we can all get outta
here pretty quick, huh?

106
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:45,532
I don't know about the rest of you,

107
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,737
but I happen to have tickets
to that ball game tonight.

108
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,655
Yanks and Cleveland.

109
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,532
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

110
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,284
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

111
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:55,494
You know... Phoom!

112
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,830
A real jug handle. You know?

113
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,166
Phoom!

114
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,585
You're a real baseball fan,
aren't you? Huh? Yeah.

115
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,128
Where do we sit here?

116
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:07,298
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

117
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,800
One, two, three, four, five...
so on, around the table.

118
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,135
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

119
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,303
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

120
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:15,431
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

121
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:17,767
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

122
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:21,103
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

123
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:23,522
What was your impression of
the prosecuting attorney?

124
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,316
Okay. Two. You're two.

125
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:26,567
I beg pardon?

126
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:30,821
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

127
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:34,033
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

128
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:37,119
I think he... he did an expert job.

129
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,206
A lot of drive too,
you know? Real drive.

130
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,941
Okay, fellas, can we
hold it down a minute?

131
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:42,375
Sure.

132
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,043
Uh, fellas.

133
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:47,605
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

134
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,425
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

135
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:55,179
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid
kills his father... bing, just like that.

136
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,848
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

137
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,850
They let those kids
run wild up there.

138
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,645
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

139
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:04,313
Is... Is everyone here?

140
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,232
The old man is inside.

141
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,943
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

142
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:10,987
You a Yankee fan?

143
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:12,630
No. Baltimore.

144
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,049
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,869
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

146
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:21,872
Who have they got?

147
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:24,375
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

148
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,002
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

149
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:29,146
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I... I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

150
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,716
Baltimore?

151
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:34,593
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

152
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:37,638
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

153
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,224
I'm, um... You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

154
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:43,602
Uh, we can, well, discuss it
first and, uh, then vote on it.

155
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:46,355
That's, of course, uh...
That's, uh, one way.

156
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:49,400
And, uh, well, we can vote
on it right now, and...

157
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,986
I think it's customary to
take a preliminary vote.

158
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:55,656
Yeah, let's... Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

159
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:00,619
Okay, then I think that, uh...

160
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,581
Of course you know that we have a
first-degree murder charge here...

161
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,750
and if we vote the
accused guilty...

162
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:09,086
uh, we've got to send
him to the chair.

163
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:12,923
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

164
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:14,759
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

165
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,654
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

166
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:24,435
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.

167
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:25,978
Um, that's the law.

168
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:28,105
Okay, are we ready?

169
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:31,208
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

170
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:38,716
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

171
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:42,620
eight, nine, 10, 11.

172
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:45,623
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

173
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,224
Those voting not guilty.

174
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,461
One. Right.

175
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:52,855
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

176
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:55,341
Well, now we know where we are.

177
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:59,612
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

178
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,431
So, what do we do now?

179
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:04,350
Well, I guess we talk.

180
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:05,768
Boy, oh, boy.

181
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,703
You really think he's innocent?

182
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,691
I don't know.

183
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:15,653
I mean, you sat in court with the
rest of us. You heard what we did.

184
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,863
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

185
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,573
He's 18 years old.

186
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,742
Well, that's old enough. He...

187
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:24,495
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

188
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,831
They proved it a dozen
different ways in court.

189
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,458
Would you like me to
list them for you?

190
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,835
No.

191
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:33,003
Then what do you want?

192
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:36,006
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

193
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:37,425
Eleven men in here
think he's guilty.

194
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,760
No one had to think about
it twice except you.

195
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:43,055
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

196
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:45,850
I don't know whether I believe
it or not. Maybe I don't.

197
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,518
So how come you vote not guilty?

198
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,520
Well, there were 11
votes for guilty.

199
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:52,356
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

200
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:54,525
without talking about it first.

201
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:57,044
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

202
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:00,489
What, just because I voted fast?

203
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,992
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

204
00:13:02,993 --> 00:13:05,870
You couldn't change my mind if
you talked for a hundred years.

205
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:07,972
I'm not trying to change
your mind. It's just that...

206
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,791
We're talking about
somebody's life here.

207
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,960
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

208
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,462
"Supposing we're wrong."

209
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,547
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

210
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,649
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

211
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,218
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

212
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,888
Suppose we do it in
five minutes. So what?

213
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,098
Let's take an hour.

214
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,117
The ball game doesn't
start till 8:00.

215
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,983
Who's got something to say?

216
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,485
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

217
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:40,279
Great. I heard a pretty
good story last night.

218
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,464
That's not why we're sitting here.

219
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:46,719
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

220
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,805
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

221
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:54,251
Look, this kid's been kicked
around all of his life...

222
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:58,255
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

223
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:00,549
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

224
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,552
his father was serving a
jail term for forgery.

225
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,971
It's not a very happy beginning.

226
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,182
He's a... a wild, angry kid.

227
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:09,975
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

228
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:13,771
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

229
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:16,065
He's had a... He's had a
pretty miserable 18 years.

230
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:19,109
I... I just think we owe
him a few words. That's all.

231
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,738
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

232
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,908
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

233
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:27,873
He's lucky he got it.
You know what I mean?

234
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,497
- You know it.
- Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

235
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:33,457
We heard the facts, didn't we?

236
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,336
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

237
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:39,797
Listen, I've lived among
them all my life.

238
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:43,217
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

239
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:45,135
I mean, they're born liars.

240
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:48,556
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

241
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:51,475
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

242
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:54,144
I think certain things should
be pointed out to this man.

243
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,313
Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

244
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,666
Come on. We have a job
to do. Now let's do it.

245
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:02,753
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

246
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:06,198
"The breakfast with
the built-in bounce."

247
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:07,908
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

248
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:10,160
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

249
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,954
Oh, I'm sorry.

250
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:14,498
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

251
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,292
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

252
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,085
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

253
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:18,919
Okay. Um...

254
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,379
Okay. Um...

255
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,258
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

256
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:27,636
Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You
know, let us know what you're thinking.

257
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:30,097
And we might be able to show
you where you're mixed up.

258
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:31,849
Well, look, maybe...
Maybe this is an idea.

259
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,351
Now, I haven't given it much
thought, but it seems to me...

260
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,706
that it's up to the
group of us to convince

261
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,856
this gentleman that he's
wrong and we're right.

262
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:41,500
Now, maybe if we each took a
couple of minutes just to...

263
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:44,320
Well, it was just a quick idea.

264
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:45,863
No, no, no. That's a good one.

265
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:49,033
Uh, suppose we go once
around the table.

266
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:51,994
I guess you're first.

267
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:53,429
Well, uh...

268
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:57,391
Well, it's hard
to put into words.

269
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,419
I just think he's guilty.

270
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,005
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go".

271
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,590
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

272
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,216
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

273
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,552
The burden of proof's
on the prosecution.

274
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:11,096
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

275
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:14,308
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

276
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,368
Uh, what I meant was, is...

277
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:20,147
Well, I just think he's guilty.

278
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:21,940
I mean, somebody saw him do it.

279
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:27,071
Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I
have no personal feelings about this.

280
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:29,339
I just want to talk about facts.

281
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:32,468
Number one.

282
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:37,122
The old man lived downstairs under the
room where the killing took place.

283
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:39,333
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

284
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:43,087
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

285
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:46,048
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya".

286
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,425
A second later, he heard
a body hit the floor.

287
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,219
Ran to the door, opened it up...

288
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,721
saw the kid running down the
stairs and out of the house.

289
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:54,098
Called the police.

290
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,850
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

291
00:16:56,851 --> 00:17:00,187
The coroner fixed the time
of death around midnight.

292
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:03,357
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

293
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,609
The kid is guilty.

294
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,695
I'm just as sentimental
as the next fella.

295
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:11,657
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

296
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,200
I'm with you.

297
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,828
Okay. Are you finished?

298
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,371
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

299
00:17:17,372 --> 00:17:20,666
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

300
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,960
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

301
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:25,587
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

302
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:27,506
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

303
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:29,883
And no one saw him going
in or out of the theater.

304
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:31,593
Listen, what about the
woman across the street?

305
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:33,971
If her testimony don't
prove it, nothing does.

306
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:36,390
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

307
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:38,892
Now, fellas, please.
Let's go in order here, huh?

308
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:42,229
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

309
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,773
Here's a woman who was
lying in bed. She can't sleep.

310
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,775
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

311
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:48,694
Anyway, she looks out the window...

312
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:52,364
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

313
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,325
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

314
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:59,204
Everything fits. Look, she's
known the kid all his life.

315
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,415
His window is right opposite
hers across the el tracks...

316
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,167
and she swore she saw him do it.

317
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:05,369
Through the windows of
the passing el train.

318
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:10,174
Right. This el train had no passengers
on it. It was just being moved downtown.

319
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:13,177
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

320
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,679
you can look through the windows of an
el train when the lights are out...

321
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,098
and see what's happening
on the other side.

322
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,018
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

323
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,771
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

324
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:25,622
She's one of them too, isn't she?

325
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:30,277
You're a pretty smart
fella, aren't you?

326
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:31,779
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

327
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,072
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

328
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

329
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:40,037
Okay, now come on. Now we're
not gonna get anywhere fighting.

330
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,371
Whose turn is it next?

331
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:44,308
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

332
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:49,313
Okay, may I... Can I pass it?

333
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:52,132
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

334
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,344
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

335
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:58,096
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

336
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:02,409
I started to be convinced,
you know, very early in the case.

337
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:07,105
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

338
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:11,401
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

339
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:14,571
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

340
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:17,699
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...

341
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,035
that was very powerful.

342
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:22,913
Didn't they say something about a...
a fight and an argument...

343
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:27,417
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

344
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,962
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I...
- It was 8:00.

345
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:32,089
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

346
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,924
They couldn't hear
what it was about.

347
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,968
Then they heard the
father hit the boy twice.

348
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:38,082
Finally they saw the boy run...

349
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,681
angrily out of the house.
What does that prove?

350
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:44,434
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

351
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:47,437
Well, you said it provided a motive. The
prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

352
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,773
I don't think that was
a very strong motive.

353
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:53,443
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...

354
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:55,904
It's a normal state
of affairs with him.

355
00:19:55,905 --> 00:20:00,200
I just... I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

356
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:03,887
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

357
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:08,500
Anything else?

358
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:11,044
- No.
- Okay.

359
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:12,896
Uh, how about you?

360
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:16,692
I don't know. It's all been said.

361
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:20,862
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

362
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:25,017
This kid is five for 0.

363
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:26,977
Well, look at his record.

364
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:29,271
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

365
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:31,148
He threw a rock at a teacher.

366
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:33,525
When he was 15,
he was in reform school.

367
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:35,444
He stole a car.

368
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:38,030
He's been arrested for mugging.

369
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:40,115
He was picked up twice
for knife fighting.

370
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:42,284
Oh, yeah, they say he's
real handy with a knife.

371
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:45,162
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

372
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:48,248
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

373
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,751
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

374
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:52,336
A kid like that?

375
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:55,605
It's these kids, the way
they are nowadays.

376
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,278
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir".

377
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,305
That's right. "Sir".

378
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,349
Do you ever hear a kid call
his father that any more?

379
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,951
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

380
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:10,787
- You got any kids?
- Three.

381
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:13,498
I got one.

382
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,752
Twenty-two years old.

383
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:25,635
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

384
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:30,515
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

385
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:36,813
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying".

386
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:41,234
Well, I made a man out of him.

387
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:44,404
When he was 16, we had a fight.

388
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,366
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

389
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,872
Haven't seen him for two years.

390
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:58,085
Kids.

391
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:01,755
Work your heart out.

392
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:05,575
Well, let's get going.

393
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,995
I think we're missing
the point here.

394
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:11,498
This boy, let's say he's the product of a
broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

395
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:15,168
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

396
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,171
not to go into the reasons why
he grew up the way he did.

397
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,966
He was born in a slum. Slums are
breeding grounds for criminals.

398
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,926
I know it, and so do you.

399
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:25,185
It's no secret children
from slum backgrounds

400
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,423
are potential menaces to society.

401
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:29,975
- Now I think...
- Brother, you can say that again.

402
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:32,246
The kids who crawl out of
these places are real trash.

403
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:35,476
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

404
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:37,571
I, uh... I've lived in
a slum all my life.

405
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:39,435
- Wait a minute.
- Please, I...

406
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:42,237
I played in backyards that
were filled with garbage.

407
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:44,364
I mean, maybe you can
still smell it on me.

408
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,782
Now, listen, sonny.

409
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:47,451
Come on now. There's nothing
personal about this.

410
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:50,078
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

411
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,247
Let's not be so sensitive.

412
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:54,166
This sensitivity I can understand.

413
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:58,895
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

414
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:02,190
Look, your turn down
there. Let's go.

415
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:06,344
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

416
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,180
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

417
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:10,474
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

418
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,893
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

419
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:15,687
Oh, now wait a minute. We decided
to do this a certain way.

420
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:17,397
I think we ought to
stick to that way.

421
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:19,483
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

422
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,568
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

423
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,295
K-I-D. Kid.

424
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:29,534
What? Listen, just because I'm
trying to keep this thing organized?

425
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,745
Here, you take it. You take
on the responsibility.

426
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:33,705
I'll just... I'll keep my
mouth shut. That's all.

427
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,791
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

428
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:37,209
Don't tell me to calm down.

429
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,419
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

430
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,963
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

431
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,219
Listen, you think it's
funny or something?

432
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:45,675
Hey, forget it, fella. The whole
thing's unimportant. Come on.

433
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:48,887
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

434
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:50,722
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

435
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:53,642
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

436
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:55,619
You stay in there and
pitch. You know?

437
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,788
All right. Let's hear
from somebody.

438
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:04,361
Well, if you want me to tell you how
I feel about it, it's all right with me.

439
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:06,571
Boy, I don't care what you do.

440
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,533
All right, I don't have
anything brilliant.

441
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:11,743
I only know as much as you do.

442
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:15,580
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

443
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:19,851
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

444
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:22,170
Everybody sounded so
positive, you know?

445
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,714
I began to get a peculiar
feeling about this trial.

446
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,883
I mean, nothing is that positive.

447
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,094
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

448
00:24:29,095 --> 00:24:31,888
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

449
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,932
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

450
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:36,518
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

451
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,980
I mean, he... he let too many
things go by, little things that...

452
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,816
What little things? Listen, when
these fellas don't ask questions...

453
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:45,402
it's because they know the answers
already and they figure they'll be hurt.

454
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:49,406
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

455
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:50,782
I mean it's possible.

456
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:52,584
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

457
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:58,348
I... I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

458
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:02,294
I'd have asked for
another lawyer, I think.

459
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:04,921
I mean, if I was on
trial for my life...

460
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:09,801
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

461
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:13,863
Look, there was one alleged
eyewitness to this killing.

462
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:17,767
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

463
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:19,978
And there was a lot of
circumstantial evidence.

464
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:23,565
But actually, those two witnesses were
the entire case for the prosecution.

465
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:25,442
Supposing they're wrong.

466
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:27,319
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

467
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,279
What's the point of
having witnesses at all?

468
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,990
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

469
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:33,617
Those people sat on
the stand under oath.

470
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:35,243
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

471
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,053
Could they be wrong?

472
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:40,749
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

473
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,667
Oh, come on. Nobody can
know a thing like that.

474
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,461
This isn't an exact science.

475
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,895
That's right. It isn't.

476
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,803
Okay, let...
Let's get to the point.

477
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,473
What about the switch knife they
found in the old man's chest?

478
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,975
Uh, wait a minute. There's
some people who haven't talked yet.

479
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:01,061
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

480
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:03,480
Be quiet a second, will you?

481
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:04,856
What about it, this...

482
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:08,401
the knife this fine upright boy admitted
buying the night of the killing?

483
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,819
Let's talk about it.

484
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,155
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

485
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,990
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

486
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:17,160
We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?

487
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,281
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

488
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:22,874
Say, could you bring us the knife?

489
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,768
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

490
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:29,673
The knife and the way it was bought is
pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

491
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:31,424
- I do.
- Good.

492
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:34,010
Now, suppose we take these
facts one at a time.

493
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,347
One. The boy admitted going out of the
house at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

494
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:39,349
after being slapped several
times by his father.

495
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,185
No, no. No, he didn't say
"slapped". He said "punched".

496
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,688
There's a difference between
a slap and a punch.

497
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:47,357
After being hit several
times by his father.

498
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:49,693
Two. He went directly to a
neighborhood junk shop...

499
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:51,903
- where he bought one of those...
- Switch knives.

500
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,989
Switchblade knives.

501
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,865
This wasn't what you'd
call an ordinary knife.

502
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:58,451
It had a very unusual
carved handle and blade.

503
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,036
The storekeeper who
sold it to him...

504
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,248
said it was the only one of its
kind he had ever had in stock.

505
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:07,085
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

506
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:08,670
Am I right so far?

507
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,880
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

508
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:14,134
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

509
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:17,178
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

510
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,055
Four.

511
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,558
They identified the death
weapon in court...

512
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,144
as that very same knife.

513
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:27,022
Five. He arrived
home at about 10:00.

514
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:29,441
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

515
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:31,443
begin to diverge slightly.

516
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:34,112
He claims that he went to
a movie at about 11:30...

517
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:38,241
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

518
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,368
He also claims that the two
detectives who arrested him...

519
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,746
threw him down a half
a flight of stairs.

520
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,664
Now, what happened
to the switch knife?

521
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:47,375
He claims that it fell through a hole in
his pocket on the way to the movies...

522
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:52,130
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

523
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,174
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

524
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:57,761
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

525
00:27:57,762 --> 00:27:59,804
No one in the house saw
him go out at 11:30.

526
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,389
No one at the theater
identified him.

527
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,710
He couldn't even remember the
names of the pictures he saw.

528
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,355
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

529
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:11,649
The boy stayed home, had another
fight with his father...

530
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,445
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

531
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:18,281
He even remembered to wipe the
knife clean of fingerprints.

532
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:20,992
Now are you trying to tell
me that this knife...

533
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,994
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

534
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:25,455
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

535
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:28,208
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

536
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:30,293
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

537
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:32,587
and that somebody else stabbed
his father with a similar knife.

538
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:33,880
It's just possible.

539
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,565
Take a look at this knife.

540
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:39,677
It's a very unusual knife.

541
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:41,304
I've never seen one like it.

542
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:44,182
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

543
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:47,227
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

544
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:49,646
I'm just saying a
coincidence is possible.

545
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:51,247
And I say it's not possible.

546
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,572
Where did that come from?

547
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,032
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

548
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,617
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,327
Where did you get it?

550
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,663
I went out walking for a
couple of hours last night.

551
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:08,748
I walked through the
boy's neighborhood.

552
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:11,835
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

553
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:13,378
It cost six dollars.

554
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:16,589
It's against the law to buy
or sell switchblade knives.

555
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,925
That's right. I broke the law.

556
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:23,012
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

557
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,181
Maybe there are 10
knives like that. So what?

558
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,059
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

559
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,438
You found another knife like it. What's that,
the discovery of the age or something?

560
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,857
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

561
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:35,733
with exactly the
same kind of knife?

562
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,068
The odds are a million-to-one.

563
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,879
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

564
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,074
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

565
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,236
There's no point in standing
around all over the place.

566
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:50,248
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

567
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:53,084
What's interesting about it?
Interesting.

568
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,044
Well, I don't know. I just
thought it was interesting.

569
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:56,921
There are still 11 of us
here who think he's guilty.

570
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:59,299
Right. What do you think
you're gonna accomplish?

571
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,217
You're not gonna
change anybody's mind.

572
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,678
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

573
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,823
The kid will be tried again and
found guilty sure as he's born.

574
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,226
That's probably right.

575
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:13,521
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.

576
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:16,858
It's only one night.
A boy may die.

577
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,486
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

578
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:22,030
Someone send for Potsy the
policeman and get a pinochle deck...

579
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:24,616
and, uh, we'll just sweat the
whole thing out right here.

580
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:29,162
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

581
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:32,916
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

582
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,919
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

583
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,796
You guys can talk the ears right
off my head. You know what I mean?

584
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,591
I got three garages of mine goin'
to pot while you're talking.

585
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,343
So let's get done
and get outta here.

586
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:46,846
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

587
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,390
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

588
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,934
Hey, let's hold it down.

589
00:30:50,935 --> 00:30:53,369
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

590
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,607
Well, what about it?

591
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:59,208
You're the only one.

592
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,177
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

593
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,013
I'm gonna call for another vote.

594
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:18,670
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

595
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,797
I'll abstain.

596
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,675
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

597
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:27,570
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

598
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:32,742
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

599
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,982
Well, that's it. If you
want to try it, I'm ready.

600
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:40,525
All right.
Let's do it the hard way.

601
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,527
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?

602
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:44,696
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

603
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:45,822
Here, pass these along.

604
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,674
Is that the right time?

605
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:20,915
Guilty.

606
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:24,752
Guilty.

607
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,172
Guilty.

608
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,676
Guilty.

609
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,345
Guilty.

610
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:37,432
Guilty.

611
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,768
Guilty.

612
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,104
Guilty.

613
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,565
Guilty.

614
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,263
Not guilty.

615
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,765
Guilty.

616
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,516
Boy, how do you like that?

617
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,061
Oh, and another chap
flaps his wings.

618
00:32:58,062 --> 00:33:00,897
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

619
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,232
Excuse me.
This was a secret ballot.

620
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,859
We all agreed on that, no?

621
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,070
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...

622
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,030
Secret? What do you mean secret?

623
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:12,341
There are no secrets in a
jury room. I know who it was.

624
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,994
Brother, you really are something.

625
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,080
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

626
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:20,458
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

627
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:23,836
about some underprivileged kid just
couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

628
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,421
and you change your vote.

629
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,632
If that isn't the most sick...

630
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,386
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

631
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:33,429
Oh, now just wait a minute.

632
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,098
Listen, you can't talk
to me like that.

633
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,016
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

634
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,435
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

635
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,850
It doesn't matter. He's
very excitable. Sit down.

636
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,780
Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

637
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:45,700
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

638
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,653
Someone starts telling us fairy
tales, and we're listenin'!

639
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,488
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

640
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,490
What made you change your vote?

641
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,200
He didn't change his vote.

642
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,451
I did.

643
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,495
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

644
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,539
Would you like me to tell you why?

645
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,499
No, I wouldn't like
you to tell me why.

646
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,127
I'd like to make it clear
anyway, if you don't mind.

647
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,712
Do we have to listen to this?

648
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,547
The man wants to talk.

649
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,215
Thank you.

650
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,635
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

651
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:14,971
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

652
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:17,014
He just isn't sure.

653
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,934
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

654
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:23,146
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

655
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:24,939
I respect his motives.

656
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,569
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.

657
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,446
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

658
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:33,781
I'm talking here! You have
no right to leave this room!

659
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,742
He can't hear you. He never will.

660
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,426
Let's sit down.

661
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,791
Shall we continue?

662
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,085
Well, I... I think we
ought to take a break.

663
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:50,298
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

664
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:53,342
Okay.

665
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:55,194
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

666
00:34:56,472 --> 00:34:58,906
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

667
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,452
I wish I could figure out some
way we could break it up.

668
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:10,026
You know, in advertising...
I told you I worked in an agency.

669
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,196
Well, there's some pretty
strange people working there.

670
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:15,364
Well, they're not strange
really, I guess.

671
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,075
It's just that they have peculiar
ways of expressing themselves.

672
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,410
You know what I mean.

673
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,811
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

674
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,956
What do you do?

675
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,209
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

676
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,504
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

677
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:32,590
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

678
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:36,177
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

679
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:38,888
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

680
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:40,932
And it kills me.

681
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,517
It's the weirdest
thing in the world...

682
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:45,937
the way they sometimes precede their
idea with a little phrase, see, like...

683
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,940
Some account exec will
get up, and he'll say, uh...

684
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,858
Okay, here's an idea.

685
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,570
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it.

686
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,782
I mean, it's idiotic,
but it's funny, huh?

687
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:02,386
I, uh... I got a little
excited back there. I...

688
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,139
didn't mean to get nasty.

689
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:09,810
I'm glad you're not one of those lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

690
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:29,395
I don't know what's the matter with
that fan. Can't seem to get it to start.

691
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,117
Hey, you a salesman?

692
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:42,718
I'm an architect.

693
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,223
You know what the soft sell is?

694
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:52,061
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

695
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,439
I got a different technique.

696
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,009
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

697
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,361
Tricks. You know?

698
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,405
Yeah.

699
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:06,075
Hit 'em where they live.
That's my motto.

700
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,246
I made 27 grand last
year sellin' marmalade.

701
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,582
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

702
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,587
Hey, what are you gettin'
outta this... kicks?

703
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,326
Or did somebody bump you on the head one
time and you haven't gotten over it?

704
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,136
Maybe.

705
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,664
You know, you do-gooders
are all alike.

706
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,434
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

707
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,355
But what are you
wasting our time for?

708
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:41,152
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

709
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,682
This kid is guilty, pal.

710
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,185
It's as plain as the
nose on your face.

711
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:51,520
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

712
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:54,523
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

713
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:57,205
What difference does it make if you
get it here or at the ball game?

714
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,863
Oh, no difference, pal.

715
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,757
No difference at all.

716
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,545
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

717
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:18,923
Oh, they're about the
same as anyone else.

718
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:21,817
Boy, what a murderous day.

719
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,845
You think we'll be much longer?

720
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:26,555
I don't know.

721
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,557
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

722
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,184
Not a doubt in the whole world.

723
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:32,828
We should...
Should've been done already.

724
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,315
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

725
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,834
Beats workin'.

726
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,119
You think he's not guilty, huh?

727
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,054
I don't know. It's possible.

728
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:54,583
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

729
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:57,086
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

730
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:59,355
Supposing you were the
one who was on trial.

731
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,049
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

732
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,637
I'm just a workingman. My boss
does the supposing. But...

733
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,239
Well, I'll try one.

734
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:15,121
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

735
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,322
Are you ready?

736
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:26,615
Hup.

737
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:27,616
That one.

738
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,385
Sorry, blue eyes.

739
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,370
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

740
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,706
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

741
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,708
Looks like we'll be
here for dinner, huh?

742
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,169
Okay, now let's...
Let's get down to business.

743
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,628
Now, who wants to start it off?

744
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:41,130
- I would.
- Okay, go.

745
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,299
You down there.

746
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,261
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya".

747
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,972
A second later, he heard
the body hit the floor.

748
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:53,934
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

749
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:55,394
What does that mean to you?

750
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,048
I was wondering how
clearly the old man could

751
00:39:57,049 --> 00:39:58,856
have heard the boy's voice
through the ceiling.

752
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,983
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

753
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,902
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

754
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,320
Well, it was another apartment.

755
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:06,989
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

756
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,657
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

757
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:10,201
And don't forget the
lady across the street.

758
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:13,079
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

759
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,623
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

760
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:17,666
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

761
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,585
It's like talking
into a dead phone.

762
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:22,838
She said she saw the killing through
the windows of a moving elevated train.

763
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,425
There were six cars on the train. She saw
the killing through the last two cars.

764
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,344
She remembered the most
insignificant details.

765
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,471
I don't see how you
can argue with that.

766
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:35,117
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

767
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,361
Hey!

768
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:46,962
This isn't a game.

769
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,494
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

770
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,329
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

771
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,666
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

772
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,709
- This isn't a game?
- Calm down.

773
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,130
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

774
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:07,550
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

775
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,468
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

776
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,428
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

777
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:14,181
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

778
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:16,158
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

779
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,811
I think that's a pretty
good guess. Anyone else?

780
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:21,689
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

781
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,607
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

782
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:25,609
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

783
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:30,739
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

784
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,075
Now let's say the given
point is the open window

785
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:35,077
of the room where the
killing took place.

786
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,455
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

787
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:40,040
Now let me ask you this.

788
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,376
Has anyone here ever lived
near the el tracks?

789
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:46,088
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

790
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,840
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

791
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,091
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

792
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,719
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

793
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,388
I lived in a second-floor
apartment near the el line once.

794
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:57,533
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

795
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,685
You can hardly hear yourself think.

796
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:00,436
All right, you can't
hear yourself think.

797
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,938
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

798
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:06,650
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

799
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:10,821
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.

800
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,490
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

801
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:16,327
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

802
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:17,995
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

803
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:24,084
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

804
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:27,504
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

805
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:29,924
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

806
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,342
Now, just a minute.

807
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:35,863
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

808
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:40,017
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

809
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:45,064
we can assume that the body hit the
floor just as the train went by.

810
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:49,610
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window...

811
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:53,197
a full 10 seconds before
the body hit the floor.

812
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:55,491
The old man, according
to his own testimony...

813
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:58,494
"I'm gonna kill you", body hitting
the floor a split second later...

814
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:01,038
would have had to hear the
boy make this statement...

815
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,998
with the el roaring past his nose.

816
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,625
It's not possible he
could've heard it.

817
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,877
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

818
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:09,338
He said he yelled at the top of his
voice. That's good enough for me.

819
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,674
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

820
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:12,883
With the el roaring by?

821
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:15,344
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

822
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:20,057
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

823
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:24,186
You know something? I don't
think he could've heard it.

824
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:26,605
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

825
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:28,565
Oh, what are you
people talking about?

826
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:30,693
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

827
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,695
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

828
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,989
Attention maybe.

829
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,991
You keep coming in with
these bright sayings!

830
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:40,119
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

831
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,429
What are you talking
to him like that for?

832
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,792
Guy talks like that to an old man really
ought to get stepped on, you know?

833
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,727
You ought to have
more respect, mister.

834
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,316
If you say stuff like that to him
again, I'm gonna lay you out.

835
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:07,229
Now you go ahead. You...
You say anything you like.

836
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,358
Why do you think the
old man might lie?

837
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,878
It was just that I looked at
him for a very long time.

838
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:18,741
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

839
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,409
Or did you notice that?

840
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,995
I mean, to come to court like that.

841
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,763
Why...

842
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,752
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

843
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:32,729
And he walked very
slowly to the stand.

844
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:37,509
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

845
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,278
because he was ashamed.

846
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:43,824
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

847
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:50,105
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

848
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,566
who has been nothing
all his life...

849
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:55,069
who has never had recognition...

850
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,254
or his name in the newspapers.

851
00:44:57,822 --> 00:45:00,115
Nobody knows him.

852
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:02,242
Nobody quotes him.

853
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:06,305
Nobody seeks his
advice after 75 years.

854
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,018
Gentlemen, that's a very
sad thing... to be nothing.

855
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:16,064
A man like this needs to be
quoted, to be listened to.

856
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:18,634
To be quoted just once.

857
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,611
Very important to him.

858
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:23,514
It would be so hard for him to
recede into the background...

859
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,307
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

860
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:28,268
What are you trying to do... tell us he'd
lie just so he could be important once?

861
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:30,979
No. He wouldn't really lie.

862
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,525
But perhaps he made himself
believe he heard those words...

863
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,819
and recognized the boy's face.

864
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,196
That's the most fantastic
story I've ever heard.

865
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:42,341
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

866
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,419
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

867
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,754
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

868
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:57,156
You can say what you like.

869
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,341
I still don't see how anybody
can think he's not guilty.

870
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,927
There's something else I'd like
to talk about for a minute.

871
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:03,637
Thanks.

872
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:07,015
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you".

873
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:08,684
- But supposing...
- You didn't prove it at all.

874
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:11,562
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

875
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:14,064
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

876
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:15,649
Probably thousands.

877
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,359
I could kill you
for that, darling.

878
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,361
Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you.

879
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:20,737
Get in there, Rocky,
and kill him.

880
00:46:20,738 --> 00:46:22,698
We say it every day. That doesn't
mean we're really gonna kill anybody.

881
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,575
Wait a minute. What are you
trying to give us here?

882
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:28,370
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you".
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

883
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:29,788
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

884
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,166
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

885
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,709
Well, gee, now I don't know.

886
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,505
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

887
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:40,340
He called me an idiot,
so I yelled at him.

888
00:46:40,341 --> 00:46:43,385
Now listen! This guy's trying to make
you believe things that aren't so.

889
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:45,554
The kid said he was gonna
kill him, and he did kill him.

890
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:48,599
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...

891
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,476
so the whole neighborhood
could hear him?

892
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,394
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

893
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:57,232
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

894
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:00,168
He doesn't even
speak good English.

895
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,408
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

896
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:07,910
You what?

897
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,429
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

898
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:12,748
Yeah, I'm sure.

899
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:15,292
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

900
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:18,186
Well, if this isn't
the living end. Huh?

901
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:24,985
What are you basing it on...
the stories this guy made up?

902
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,930
You ought to write for one of
those kooky detective magazines.

903
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,848
You'd make a fortune.

904
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:33,368
For crying out loud. The kid's own
lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.

905
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,437
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

906
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:37,314
You could see it.

907
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:41,001
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

908
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:43,612
Look, the kid had a
lawyer, didn't he?

909
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:46,532
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

910
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,451
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

911
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:51,245
He was court-appointed.

912
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,163
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

913
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:56,500
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

914
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,418
It's the kind of case that
brings him nothing...

915
00:47:58,419 --> 00:48:01,463
no money, no glory, not even
much chance of winning.

916
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:04,466
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

917
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:07,469
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

918
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,555
and, as you pointed out a minute
ago, obviously he didn't.

919
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,474
Of course he didn't. Huh.

920
00:48:12,475 --> 00:48:14,851
Who the heck could?

921
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:17,854
Except maybe some guy's
mother or somebody. I...

922
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:20,190
Ah, look. Will you
look at the time, huh?

923
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:22,818
- Come on. For crying out...
- Pardon me.

924
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:25,237
- I have made some notes here...
- Notes.

925
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:27,948
And I would like to...
please, to say something.

926
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:30,284
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

927
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:34,788
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

928
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:39,501
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

929
00:48:39,502 --> 00:48:43,672
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

930
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:46,049
There is a question I
would like to ask.

931
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,428
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

932
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:52,848
Now, this happened at
10 minutes after 12:00.

933
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:55,392
Now, how was he
caught by the police?

934
00:48:55,393 --> 00:48:59,980
He came back home,
uh, at 3:00 or so...

935
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:03,817
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

936
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:08,488
Now, my question is, if he
really had killed his father...

937
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:11,783
why would he come back
home three hours later?

938
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:14,745
Wouldn't he be afraid
of being caught?

939
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:16,580
He came home to get his knife.

940
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:19,207
It's not nice to go around leaving
knives sticking in people's chests.

941
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:22,044
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

942
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:24,379
I don't see
anything funny about it.

943
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,008
The boy knew the knife could be
identified as the one he had just bought.

944
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:30,260
He had to get it
before the police did.

945
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:32,542
But if he knew the knife
could be identified,

946
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:34,848
why did he leave it there
in the first place?

947
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:38,226
Well, I think we can assume the boy
ran out in a state of panic...

948
00:49:38,227 --> 00:49:40,687
after having just
killed his father.

949
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:43,732
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

950
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:46,735
Ah. This then depends on
your definition of panic.

951
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:49,196
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

952
00:49:49,197 --> 00:49:51,865
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

953
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:55,994
Now, where did this panic
start and where did it end?

954
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:58,455
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

955
00:49:58,456 --> 00:50:02,084
I don't believe I have to be
loyal to one side or the other.

956
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,960
I'm simply asking questions.

957
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:07,047
Well, this is just off the
top of my head, but, uh...

958
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:09,633
well, if I were the boy and I'd
done the stabbing and everything...

959
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:11,843
I'd take a chance and
go back for the knife.

960
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:14,429
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

961
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:17,015
and that the body wouldn't be
discovered till the next day.

962
00:50:17,016 --> 00:50:19,142
Well, after all, it was
the middle of the night.

963
00:50:19,143 --> 00:50:21,728
I'll bet he'd figured nobody would
find the body till the next day.

964
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:23,814
Pardon. This is my whole point.

965
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:27,609
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...

966
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,278
that is, a moment after
the train went by...

967
00:50:30,279 --> 00:50:33,365
she screamed and then went
to telephone the police.

968
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:36,827
Now, the boy certainly must
have heard the scream...

969
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:40,414
so he knew that
somebody saw something.

970
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:43,291
I just don't think that
he would have gone back.

971
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:46,128
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

972
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,879
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

973
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,341
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

974
00:50:51,342 --> 00:50:54,469
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

975
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,013
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

976
00:50:57,014 --> 00:50:59,975
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

977
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:03,770
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

978
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:06,481
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

979
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:09,484
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

980
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:12,320
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

981
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:14,072
during the time the
killing took place.

982
00:51:14,073 --> 00:51:15,907
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

983
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:17,701
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

984
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:19,578
He's twisting the facts,
I'm telling you.

985
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:22,998
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

986
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:25,000
Well, did or didn't he?

987
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:28,295
- He says he did.
- Says he did? Boy! How do you like that?

988
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:31,339
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

989
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,675
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

990
00:51:33,676 --> 00:51:35,594
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

991
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:37,387
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

992
00:51:37,388 --> 00:51:39,181
These guys keep going
off every which way.

993
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:41,183
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

994
00:51:41,184 --> 00:51:44,436
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

995
00:51:44,437 --> 00:51:47,022
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

996
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:49,483
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

997
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:53,253
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

998
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:59,659
I never saw so much
time spent on nothing.

999
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,469
It only takes a second.

1000
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:05,957
Okay. I guess the fastest way is to
find out who's voting not guilty.

1001
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,810
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

1002
00:52:09,962 --> 00:52:13,632
Still the same. One, two,
three not guilty. Nine guilty.

1003
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:15,383
So, now where are we?

1004
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:18,887
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

1005
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:21,723
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

1006
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:28,188
What are ya talking about? I mean, we're
all going crazy in here or something.

1007
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:32,067
The kid is guilty. Why don't
you listen to the facts?

1008
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:34,402
Tell him, will ya? Now this
is getting to be a joke.

1009
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:37,697
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1010
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:41,451
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1011
00:52:41,452 --> 00:52:44,037
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1012
00:52:44,038 --> 00:52:48,416
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1013
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:50,252
There is a reasonable
doubt in my mind.

1014
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:53,338
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing
but words. Here, look at this.

1015
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:58,343
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1016
00:52:58,344 --> 00:53:00,428
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1017
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:03,181
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1018
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:05,433
Oh, brilliant.

1019
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:07,811
I'm telling ya,
this is the craziest.

1020
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:10,063
I mean, what are we
supposed to believe?

1021
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:12,983
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?

1022
00:53:12,984 --> 00:53:16,778
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1023
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:19,322
he'd be trying to
tell you that, uh...

1024
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:21,783
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1025
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:24,452
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1026
00:53:24,453 --> 00:53:27,539
and see the kid tearing down the
steps 15 seconds after the killing?

1027
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,083
He's just saying so to
be important, right?

1028
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:31,644
I mean, what's the point
of the whole thing?

1029
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,961
Wait. Hold it a
second, will you?

1030
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:35,255
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1031
00:53:35,256 --> 00:53:37,299
and pop-ups are fallin' for
base hits wherever we look.

1032
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,635
Hold it a second. Now, look... Did
the old man say he ran to the door?

1033
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:42,555
Ran, walked. What's the difference?
He got on, didn't he?

1034
00:53:42,581 --> 00:53:43,680
I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1035
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:46,308
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1036
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:49,811
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1037
00:53:49,812 --> 00:53:52,272
He said he went from his
bedroom to the front door.

1038
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:53,982
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1039
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:56,318
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1040
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,653
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1041
00:53:58,654 --> 00:54:00,964
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1042
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,558
Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all
over again so you can get everything straight?

1043
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:04,284
Mr. Foreman.

1044
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:06,995
How come you're the only one in this
room wants to see exhibits all the time?

1045
00:54:06,996 --> 00:54:09,789
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1046
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:12,709
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1047
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,753
We're not, not unless
somebody else wants to.

1048
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:16,546
But I'd like to find
out if an old man...

1049
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:19,007
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1050
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:21,509
can get from his bedroom to
his front door in 15 seconds.

1051
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,261
- He said 20 seconds.
- He said 15.

1052
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:25,513
He said 20 seconds. What are
you trying to distort...

1053
00:54:25,514 --> 00:54:28,850
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1054
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:30,602
You can't judge a thing like that.

1055
00:54:30,603 --> 00:54:33,063
He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

1056
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:35,357
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1057
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:37,751
How could he be positive
about anything?

1058
00:54:45,326 --> 00:54:47,529
I don't see what you're
going to prove here.

1059
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:49,537
The man said he saw
the boy running out.

1060
00:54:49,538 --> 00:54:51,790
Well, let's see if the
details bear him out.

1061
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:54,751
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1062
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:56,503
running toward the front door...

1063
00:54:56,504 --> 00:54:59,673
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1064
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:01,883
He said he got to his own front
door as fast as he could...

1065
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:04,052
and he swore it couldn't have
been more than 15 seconds.

1066
00:55:04,053 --> 00:55:05,804
Now, if the killer began
running immediately...

1067
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:08,098
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1068
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,892
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1069
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,312
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1070
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:17,524
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1071
00:55:17,525 --> 00:55:19,317
Now that you've got that thing
in here, what about it?

1072
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:21,569
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1073
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,698
The old man's apartment was directly
beneath and exactly the same.

1074
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:27,993
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1075
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:30,078
Here's the hall.
Here are the stairs.

1076
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,414
Now, the old man was in
this bedroom right here.

1077
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,166
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1078
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,211
opened the front door just in time to
see the boy running down the stairs.

1079
00:55:38,212 --> 00:55:41,631
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1080
00:55:41,632 --> 00:55:45,260
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1081
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:47,387
Now, let's see. It was...

1082
00:55:47,388 --> 00:55:51,474
It's 12 feet from the bed to
the door. The hall is 43 feet.

1083
00:55:51,475 --> 00:55:54,769
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1084
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:58,481
walk 43 feet down and open the
front door all in 15 seconds.

1085
00:55:58,482 --> 00:56:01,276
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1086
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:03,945
He can walk only very slowly. They had
to help him into the witness chair.

1087
00:56:03,946 --> 00:56:05,697
You make it sound like a long walk.

1088
00:56:05,698 --> 00:56:08,116
For an old man who had a
stroke, it is a long walk.

1089
00:56:08,117 --> 00:56:09,241
Oh! What are you doing?

1090
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:11,636
I'm gonna try it,
see how long it took him.

1091
00:56:11,662 --> 00:56:13,011
What do you mean,
you want to try it?

1092
00:56:13,012 --> 00:56:15,098
Why didn't his lawyer bring
it up if it's so important?

1093
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:16,381
Maybe he just didn't
think about it, huh?

1094
00:56:16,382 --> 00:56:18,835
What do you mean, didn't think of it?
You think the man's an idiot or something?

1095
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:20,462
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1096
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,213
Listen, smart guy. Don't matter
whether I thought of it.

1097
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:24,524
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1098
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,487
Maybe he didn't bring it
up because it would have

1099
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:28,470
meant bullying and badgering
a helpless old man.

1100
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:31,890
You know that doesn't sit very well with
a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1101
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:34,684
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1102
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:37,812
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1103
00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:40,774
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1104
00:56:40,775 --> 00:56:43,485
Oh, that's crazy. You can't
recreate a thing like that.

1105
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:45,779
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1106
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,881
I'll pace from that
wall and back again.

1107
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:52,994
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are
you wasting everybody's time in here for?

1108
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:55,955
According to you, it'll only take 15
seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.

1109
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:01,586
Come on. Knock it off.

1110
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:03,171
Okay.

1111
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:05,298
Okay. Okay, killer.

1112
00:57:05,299 --> 00:57:06,983
Yeah.

1113
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,346
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1114
00:57:11,347 --> 00:57:13,932
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1115
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:15,702
Has anybody got a watch
with a second hand?

1116
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:16,184
I have.

1117
00:57:16,185 --> 00:57:18,686
When you want me to start, stamp
your foot. That'll be the body falling.

1118
00:57:18,687 --> 00:57:20,688
You can time me from there.

1119
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:22,857
What are we gonna do,
play charades now?

1120
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:24,984
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1121
00:57:24,985 --> 00:57:26,986
Well, I want to wait till
the second hand reaches 60.

1122
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:29,005
Oh, come on.

1123
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:38,723
Come on. Speed it up. He could
walk twice as fast as that.

1124
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:42,644
You want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

1125
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:01,980
Lock. Door. Stop.

1126
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:04,065
- Right.
- What's the time?

1127
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:07,402
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

1128
00:58:07,403 --> 00:58:09,737
This is what I think happened.

1129
00:58:09,738 --> 00:58:12,657
The old man heard the fight between the
boy and his father a few hours earlier.

1130
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:15,577
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1131
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:17,410
heard the woman scream
from across the street,

1132
00:58:17,436 --> 00:58:19,164
got to his front door
as fast as he could...

1133
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:21,833
heard somebody racing down the
stairs and assumed it was the boy.

1134
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:23,751
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1135
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:29,812
Brother, I've seen all kinds
of dishonesty in my day,

1136
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:32,385
but this little display
takes the cake.

1137
00:58:32,386 --> 00:58:34,863
You all come in here with
your hearts bleeding all

1138
00:58:34,864 --> 00:58:37,182
over the floor about
slum kids and injustice.

1139
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,267
You listen to some fairy tales.

1140
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:41,644
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1141
00:58:41,645 --> 00:58:44,689
Well, you're not getting through
to me. I've had enough.

1142
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,816
What's the matter with you guys?

1143
00:58:46,817 --> 00:58:49,611
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1144
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:51,487
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1145
00:58:51,488 --> 00:58:53,781
Slip through our fingers?
Are you his executioner?

1146
00:58:53,782 --> 00:58:55,550
I'm one of 'em!

1147
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:58,536
Perhaps you'd like
to pull the switch.

1148
00:58:58,537 --> 00:59:00,622
For this kid, you bet I would.

1149
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:03,975
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

1150
00:59:04,752 --> 00:59:06,815
Ever since you walked into
this room, you've been

1151
00:59:06,816 --> 00:59:08,755
acting like a self-appointed
public avenger.

1152
00:59:08,756 --> 00:59:10,819
You want to see this
boy die because you

1153
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:13,134
personally want it,
not because of the facts.

1154
00:59:13,135 --> 00:59:15,386
- You're a sadist.
- You...

1155
00:59:15,387 --> 00:59:19,307
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1156
00:59:19,308 --> 00:59:21,826
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1157
00:59:29,026 --> 00:59:31,444
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1158
00:59:31,445 --> 00:59:35,531
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...
You know, friendly little argument. It's...

1159
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:38,926
Um, listen, we're through with that
diagram. You can take it if you want.

1160
00:59:40,204 --> 00:59:41,971
Here you are. Thank you.

1161
00:59:47,419 --> 00:59:49,604
What are you lookin' at?

1162
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:12,402
I suppose somebody has
to start it off again.

1163
01:00:12,403 --> 01:00:13,174
I beg pardon.

1164
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,197
I beg pardon. What
are you so polite about?

1165
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:18,366
For the same reason you're not.

1166
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:20,468
It's the way I was brought up.

1167
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:24,289
This fighting...

1168
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,416
That's not why we
are here, to fight.

1169
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:28,893
We have a responsibility.

1170
01:00:29,962 --> 01:00:34,632
This, I have always thought, is a
remarkable thing about democracy...

1171
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:36,609
that we are...

1172
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,388
Uh, what is the word?

1173
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:43,558
Notified. That we are
notified by mail...

1174
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:47,979
to come down to this place to
decide on the guilt or innocence...

1175
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:52,108
of a man we have never
heard of before.

1176
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:56,754
We have nothing to gain or
lose by... by our verdict.

1177
01:00:57,573 --> 01:01:00,800
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1178
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:04,929
We should not make
it a personal thing.

1179
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:07,932
Thank you.

1180
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:11,419
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1181
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,255
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1182
01:01:14,256 --> 01:01:15,965
and see if the cat licks it up.

1183
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:18,384
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...

1184
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:25,016
Look how dark it's
getting out there.

1185
01:01:25,017 --> 01:01:27,577
I'll bet we're gonna
have a storm now.

1186
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:31,831
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

1187
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:36,127
Pardon me, but don't
you ever sweat?

1188
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:39,697
No, I don't.

1189
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,783
Well, listen. I, uh...

1190
01:01:41,784 --> 01:01:45,036
I was wondering if, uh, maybe...

1191
01:01:45,037 --> 01:01:47,413
maybe we should take another vote.

1192
01:01:47,414 --> 01:01:51,793
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1193
01:01:51,794 --> 01:01:53,686
Mr. Foreman?

1194
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,007
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1195
01:01:58,008 --> 01:02:01,302
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1196
01:02:01,303 --> 01:02:04,889
I think we ought to have an open
ballot... call out our votes, you know.

1197
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:07,183
Let's see who stands where.

1198
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:09,785
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

1199
01:02:12,439 --> 01:02:15,249
Okay. I'll call off
your jury numbers. One.

1200
01:02:16,151 --> 01:02:19,028
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1201
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:20,905
Two?

1202
01:02:20,906 --> 01:02:22,507
Not guilty.

1203
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:25,885
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1204
01:02:26,787 --> 01:02:28,429
Number four?

1205
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:31,707
Guilty.

1206
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:34,560
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1207
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:38,940
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1208
01:02:39,842 --> 01:02:41,592
Number seven?

1209
01:02:41,593 --> 01:02:43,386
Guilty.

1210
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:45,513
Number eight?

1211
01:02:45,514 --> 01:02:47,281
Not guilty.

1212
01:02:48,517 --> 01:02:51,519
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1213
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,788
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

1214
01:02:55,482 --> 01:02:57,608
Number 11?

1215
01:02:57,609 --> 01:02:59,527
Not guilty.

1216
01:02:59,528 --> 01:03:01,128
Number 12?

1217
01:03:01,947 --> 01:03:04,365
Number 12.

1218
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:05,967
Guilty.

1219
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,958
The vote is now six to six.

1220
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:17,211
Yeah, right. And we go into
extra innings here, huh?

1221
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:24,135
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

1222
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:26,053
A kid like that.

1223
01:03:26,054 --> 01:03:29,390
I don't think the kind of boy he
is has anything to do with it.

1224
01:03:29,391 --> 01:03:31,559
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1225
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,811
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1226
01:03:33,812 --> 01:03:35,897
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?

1227
01:03:35,898 --> 01:03:38,566
That's exactly the point this
gentleman has been making.

1228
01:03:39,193 --> 01:03:41,569
I mean, you keep shouting
at the top of your lungs.

1229
01:03:43,155 --> 01:03:45,156
I'd like to be a few years younger.

1230
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:47,174
That man gets on my...

1231
01:03:50,454 --> 01:03:53,372
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1232
01:03:53,373 --> 01:03:57,168
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1233
01:04:04,927 --> 01:04:06,802
It's gonna rain.

1234
01:04:06,803 --> 01:04:09,155
Well, how'd you figure
that out, killer?

1235
01:04:10,307 --> 01:04:12,266
How come you changed your vote?

1236
01:04:12,267 --> 01:04:14,769
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1237
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,063
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1238
01:04:17,064 --> 01:04:20,149
I don't feel that way. There were a
lot of details that never came out.

1239
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:23,778
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1240
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:26,088
You think too much.
You get mixed up.

1241
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:28,373
You know what I mean?

1242
01:04:28,399 --> 01:04:31,285
Now, listen. I don't think
you have any right...

1243
01:04:31,286 --> 01:04:33,955
Loudmouth.

1244
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:29,193
Look at that come down, will you?

1245
01:05:30,262 --> 01:05:32,221
You know...

1246
01:05:32,222 --> 01:05:34,807
this reminds me of a
storm we had last...

1247
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:38,352
Oh, when was that? November...

1248
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:41,522
I don't know. Something. It was
quite a storm we had there.

1249
01:05:41,523 --> 01:05:43,983
It was right in the
middle of a game.

1250
01:05:43,984 --> 01:05:46,694
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1251
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:49,363
but we just started to move the
ball, right off the tackle.

1252
01:05:49,364 --> 01:05:52,241
Started cutting right...
slash here and slash right in...

1253
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:54,118
cut right through.

1254
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:56,704
And, uh...

1255
01:05:56,705 --> 01:05:59,014
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1256
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:03,544
A real... He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1257
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:06,130
I wish I had another
one just like him.

1258
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:10,718
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1259
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:12,887
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1260
01:06:12,888 --> 01:06:15,723
And, uh, anyway...

1261
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:17,892
we're starting to
move along real nice.

1262
01:06:17,893 --> 01:06:21,162
Their whole line is just...
they're just coming apart.

1263
01:06:22,356 --> 01:06:26,192
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1264
01:06:26,193 --> 01:06:28,919
Just whoosh...
you know, right down.

1265
01:06:30,113 --> 01:06:33,574
Well, that was murder, you know?

1266
01:06:33,575 --> 01:06:36,243
I swear, I... I nearly bawled.

1267
01:06:36,244 --> 01:06:38,679
You just...
You couldn't go nowhere.

1268
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:41,265
Well.

1269
01:06:56,807 --> 01:06:59,408
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1270
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:08,901
Hey! Huh?

1271
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:12,296
Must have been on the
same switch with the lights.

1272
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:16,467
Well, things are
looking up here, huh?

1273
01:07:17,035 --> 01:07:18,636
Yeah, huh?

1274
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,476
Boy. That's better.

1275
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,634
Hey!

1276
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:35,402
Two points.

1277
01:07:39,307 --> 01:07:41,408
Any of you guys ever
go to the Garden?

1278
01:07:43,603 --> 01:07:46,564
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1279
01:07:46,565 --> 01:07:48,833
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1280
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:51,252
You know?

1281
01:07:52,863 --> 01:07:54,463
Pardon me.

1282
01:07:55,449 --> 01:07:57,867
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1283
01:07:57,868 --> 01:08:00,327
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1284
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:01,929
Yes.

1285
01:08:03,623 --> 01:08:07,209
Say, that business before, when
that tall guy... what's-his-name...

1286
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:10,004
was trying to bait me...
That doesn't prove anything.

1287
01:08:10,005 --> 01:08:12,673
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1288
01:08:12,674 --> 01:08:16,594
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1289
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:20,181
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1290
01:08:20,182 --> 01:08:22,558
He was just trying to bait me.

1291
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:24,660
He did an excellent job.

1292
01:08:27,355 --> 01:08:29,648
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1293
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:32,276
I'm ready to walk into court right
now and declare a hung jury.

1294
01:08:32,277 --> 01:08:34,195
There's no point in this
thing going on any more.

1295
01:08:34,196 --> 01:08:35,613
Yeah. I go for that too.

1296
01:08:35,614 --> 01:08:38,532
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1297
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:41,452
I don't think the judge will accept a hung
jury. We haven't been in here very long.

1298
01:08:41,453 --> 01:08:43,204
Well, let's find out.

1299
01:08:43,205 --> 01:08:44,997
I'm not in favor of that.

1300
01:08:44,998 --> 01:08:48,292
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1301
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:51,212
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1302
01:08:51,213 --> 01:08:53,506
You still don't think there's
room for reasonable doubt?

1303
01:08:53,507 --> 01:08:54,882
No, I don't.

1304
01:08:54,883 --> 01:08:56,258
Pardon.

1305
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:59,595
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt".

1306
01:08:59,596 --> 01:09:02,239
What do you mean
I don't understand?

1307
01:09:03,225 --> 01:09:05,267
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1308
01:09:05,268 --> 01:09:07,019
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1309
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,939
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1310
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,399
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1311
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,276
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1312
01:09:14,277 --> 01:09:18,948
Hey, all right. Let's stop the
arguing for about two minutes in here.

1313
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:21,408
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1314
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:25,037
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1315
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:27,790
An important point for the
prosecution was the fact...

1316
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:30,626
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1317
01:09:30,627 --> 01:09:32,711
during the hours that the
killing took place...

1318
01:09:32,712 --> 01:09:36,674
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1319
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:39,260
This gentleman here has put up
that point in here several times.

1320
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:40,803
That's correct.

1321
01:09:40,804 --> 01:09:42,763
It was the only alibi
the boy offered...

1322
01:09:42,764 --> 01:09:45,349
and he himself couldn't back
it up with any details at all.

1323
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:48,686
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1324
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:52,231
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1325
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:55,526
I think so, if there were any
special details to remember.

1326
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:57,231
The boy couldn't remember
the names of the movies

1327
01:09:57,232 --> 01:09:58,779
he saw because be wasn't
there that night.

1328
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,906
According to the police
testimony in court...

1329
01:10:00,907 --> 01:10:04,118
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1330
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:07,121
while the body of his father was
lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1331
01:10:07,122 --> 01:10:09,790
Do you think you could remember
details under those circumstances?

1332
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:11,876
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1333
01:10:11,877 --> 01:10:14,461
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1334
01:10:14,462 --> 01:10:16,505
He named the pictures and the
stars who played in them.

1335
01:10:16,506 --> 01:10:19,758
Yes. His lawyer took great
pains to bring that out.

1336
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:22,386
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1337
01:10:22,387 --> 01:10:24,096
in which to memorize them.

1338
01:10:24,097 --> 01:10:26,849
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1339
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,601
on a particular night.

1340
01:10:28,602 --> 01:10:30,417
I'll take the testimony
of the policemen who

1341
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:32,313
interrogated the boy right
after the murder...

1342
01:10:32,314 --> 01:10:34,815
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1343
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:36,817
great emotional stress or not.

1344
01:10:36,818 --> 01:10:40,195
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1345
01:10:40,196 --> 01:10:43,532
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1346
01:10:43,533 --> 01:10:46,160
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1347
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:47,578
No, it's all right.

1348
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:50,205
I left the office at 8:30 and
went straight home and to bed.

1349
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:51,957
And the night before that?

1350
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:54,460
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1351
01:10:54,461 --> 01:10:56,545
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1352
01:10:56,546 --> 01:10:57,963
Monday night?

1353
01:10:57,964 --> 01:11:01,275
When you get down to New
Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1354
01:11:03,178 --> 01:11:05,237
Monday night?

1355
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:09,475
Monday night, uh, my wife
and I went to the movies.

1356
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:11,185
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1357
01:11:11,186 --> 01:11:14,521
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1358
01:11:14,522 --> 01:11:17,232
The, um...

1359
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:19,985
I'll tell you in a minute.
The, uh...

1360
01:11:19,986 --> 01:11:24,239
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...

1361
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,784
The...

1362
01:11:26,785 --> 01:11:29,536
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1363
01:11:29,537 --> 01:11:32,389
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1364
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:36,043
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1365
01:11:36,044 --> 01:11:38,629
Who was in The Amazing
Mrs. Bainbridge?

1366
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,383
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1367
01:11:42,384 --> 01:11:44,485
A dark, very pretty girl.

1368
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,305
Ling or Long...
something like that.

1369
01:11:48,306 --> 01:11:51,600
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1370
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:56,105
It was a very inexpensive second
feature with, uh, unknown...

1371
01:11:56,106 --> 01:11:59,333
And you weren't under an
emotional stress, were you?

1372
01:12:02,153 --> 01:12:04,363
No.

1373
01:12:04,364 --> 01:12:06,131
I wasn't.

1374
01:12:07,909 --> 01:12:09,743
I think the point is made.

1375
01:12:09,744 --> 01:12:12,579
Big point!

1376
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,832
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1377
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:19,003
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1378
01:12:19,004 --> 01:12:22,356
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1379
01:12:24,259 --> 01:12:26,593
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1380
01:12:26,594 --> 01:12:29,054
There goes your ball game.

1381
01:12:29,055 --> 01:12:31,557
It's only a shower.

1382
01:12:31,558 --> 01:12:33,809
Besides, they got the
infield covered.

1383
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:37,079
Right. Say, could I see that
knife a second, please?

1384
01:12:39,774 --> 01:12:42,192
Well, we're still
tied up six to six.

1385
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:44,278
Who's got a suggestion?

1386
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:46,363
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1387
01:12:46,364 --> 01:12:48,907
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1388
01:12:48,908 --> 01:12:51,118
Okay with me.

1389
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:53,370
Uh, there's something
I'd like to say.

1390
01:12:53,371 --> 01:12:56,999
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1391
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,961
Well, there was this whole business about
the stab wound and how it was made...

1392
01:13:00,962 --> 01:13:02,671
the downward angle of it, you know?

1393
01:13:02,672 --> 01:13:04,757
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1394
01:13:04,758 --> 01:13:06,467
They've been over it and over it.

1395
01:13:06,468 --> 01:13:08,844
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1396
01:13:08,845 --> 01:13:12,931
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7
inches tall. His father was 6'2...

1397
01:13:12,932 --> 01:13:15,184
That's a difference
of seven inches.

1398
01:13:15,185 --> 01:13:17,936
It's a very awkward thing to stab
down into the chest of someone...

1399
01:13:17,937 --> 01:13:20,022
who's more than half a
foot taller than you are.

1400
01:13:20,023 --> 01:13:22,232
Give me that.

1401
01:13:22,233 --> 01:13:25,127
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1402
01:13:26,404 --> 01:13:28,422
You...

1403
01:13:32,827 --> 01:13:35,621
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1404
01:13:35,622 --> 01:13:38,457
I'll make myself about six or
seven inches shorter, okay?

1405
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:41,685
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1406
01:13:49,385 --> 01:13:51,904
That's not funny.

1407
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:57,826
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1408
01:13:58,394 --> 01:14:00,287
Right. Nobody hurt.

1409
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:08,529
Now, this is the way I'd stab a
man who was taller than I was.

1410
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,073
Look at the angle... down and in.

1411
01:14:11,074 --> 01:14:13,242
And this is the way it was done.

1412
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:15,510
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1413
01:14:17,622 --> 01:14:21,125
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1414
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:23,060
Can you give me that?

1415
01:14:23,962 --> 01:14:25,963
Boy, I hate these things.

1416
01:14:25,964 --> 01:14:27,714
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1417
01:14:27,715 --> 01:14:29,383
- You?
- No.

1418
01:14:29,384 --> 01:14:32,261
Anybody here ever
see a knife fight?

1419
01:14:32,262 --> 01:14:35,139
Well, I have. You know,
on my back stoop...

1420
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,558
the lot across
the street, backyard.

1421
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:40,060
Switchblades came with the
neighborhood where I lived.

1422
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:43,397
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1423
01:14:43,398 --> 01:14:46,875
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1424
01:14:48,528 --> 01:14:50,921
See, you use too much
time switching hands.

1425
01:14:52,574 --> 01:14:55,175
Here's how... underhanded.

1426
01:14:57,787 --> 01:15:00,914
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1427
01:15:00,915 --> 01:15:03,625
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1428
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:05,544
That's why they're made
to open like that.

1429
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:07,713
You'd say the boy was
pretty handy with a knife?

1430
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:11,508
You think he could have made the kind
of wound that killed his father?

1431
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:15,512
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1432
01:15:15,513 --> 01:15:17,598
I feel he'd have gone
for him underhanded.

1433
01:15:17,599 --> 01:15:20,726
How do you know? Were you in the
room when the father was killed?

1434
01:15:20,727 --> 01:15:22,811
No. Neither was anybody else.

1435
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:26,106
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1436
01:15:26,107 --> 01:15:27,757
I don't think you can
determine what type of

1437
01:15:27,783 --> 01:15:29,443
wound the boy might or
might not have made...

1438
01:15:29,444 --> 01:15:32,154
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1439
01:15:32,155 --> 01:15:34,573
What do you think?

1440
01:15:34,574 --> 01:15:36,742
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1441
01:15:36,743 --> 01:15:38,677
I don't know.

1442
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,875
How about you?

1443
01:15:44,876 --> 01:15:46,787
I don't know about the rest
of them, but I'm getting a

1444
01:15:46,788 --> 01:15:48,712
little tired of this
yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1445
01:15:48,713 --> 01:15:52,257
It's gettin' us nowhere. So I
guess I'll have to break it up.

1446
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:54,885
I change my vote to not guilty.

1447
01:15:54,886 --> 01:15:58,305
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1448
01:15:58,306 --> 01:16:00,849
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1449
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:04,895
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?

1450
01:16:04,896 --> 01:16:08,941
He's right. That's not an answer.

1451
01:16:08,942 --> 01:16:11,985
What kind of a man are you?

1452
01:16:11,986 --> 01:16:15,197
You have sat here and voted
guilty with everyone else...

1453
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:19,534
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1454
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:23,889
And now you've changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

1455
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:26,333
Now listen, buddy!

1456
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:31,088
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1457
01:16:31,089 --> 01:16:33,674
- Don't you care...
- Now wait a minute!

1458
01:16:33,675 --> 01:16:37,761
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1459
01:16:37,762 --> 01:16:39,721
If you want to vote not guilty...

1460
01:16:39,722 --> 01:16:42,182
then do it because you are
convinced the man is not guilty...

1461
01:16:42,183 --> 01:16:44,059
not because you've had enough.

1462
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,728
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1463
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:50,023
Or don't you have the guts to
do what you think is right?

1464
01:16:50,024 --> 01:16:52,376
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1465
01:16:53,069 --> 01:16:56,755
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1466
01:16:58,324 --> 01:17:00,033
Look, I don't have to...

1467
01:17:00,034 --> 01:17:03,245
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1468
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:05,806
All right. I don't, uh,
think he's guilty.

1469
01:17:15,216 --> 01:17:16,925
I want another vote.

1470
01:17:16,926 --> 01:17:19,511
Okay. There's another
vote called for.

1471
01:17:19,512 --> 01:17:22,472
I guess the quickest way is a
show of hands. Anyone object?

1472
01:17:22,473 --> 01:17:25,492
Okay. All those voting not
guilty, raise your hands.

1473
01:17:26,311 --> 01:17:31,581
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1474
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:36,086
eight.

1475
01:17:39,907 --> 01:17:42,134
Um, nine.

1476
01:17:43,036 --> 01:17:48,123
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1477
01:17:48,124 --> 01:17:50,584
One, two, three.

1478
01:17:50,585 --> 01:17:53,186
Well, the vote's nine to
three in favor of acquittal.

1479
01:17:54,088 --> 01:17:56,340
I don't understand you people!

1480
01:17:56,341 --> 01:17:58,592
I mean, all these picky little
points you keep bringing up.

1481
01:17:58,593 --> 01:18:02,012
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1482
01:18:02,013 --> 01:18:05,599
You're not gonna tell me you believe that
phony story about losing the knife...

1483
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,684
and that business about
being at the movies.

1484
01:18:07,685 --> 01:18:10,771
Look, you know how these
people lie. It's born in them.

1485
01:18:10,772 --> 01:18:12,898
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1486
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:14,941
They don't know what the truth is.

1487
01:18:14,942 --> 01:18:18,737
And let me tell you, they don't need any
real big reason to kill someone either.

1488
01:18:18,738 --> 01:18:20,572
No, sir.

1489
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:23,700
They get drunk! Oh, they're
real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1490
01:18:23,701 --> 01:18:26,953
You know that. And bang...
someone's lying in the gutter.

1491
01:18:26,954 --> 01:18:30,040
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1492
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:32,209
You know what I mean? Violent!

1493
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,794
Where are you going?

1494
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:36,897
Human life don't mean as much
to them as it does to us.

1495
01:18:37,799 --> 01:18:40,884
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1496
01:18:40,885 --> 01:18:42,969
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1497
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:44,429
They don't care!

1498
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:46,723
Oh, sure, there's some
good things about 'em too.

1499
01:18:46,724 --> 01:18:48,767
Look, I'm the first
one to say that.

1500
01:18:48,768 --> 01:18:52,145
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1501
01:18:52,146 --> 01:18:55,982
Most of 'em, it's like they have
no feelings. They can do anything.

1502
01:18:55,983 --> 01:18:58,652
What's going on here?

1503
01:18:58,653 --> 01:19:00,779
I'm... I'm trying to tell ya...

1504
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,864
you're making a big
mistake, you people.

1505
01:19:02,865 --> 01:19:05,967
This kid is a liar! I know it.
I know all about them.

1506
01:19:07,578 --> 01:19:09,830
Listen to me. They're no good.

1507
01:19:09,831 --> 01:19:12,265
There's not a one of
'em who's any good.

1508
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:16,753
I mean, what...
What's happening in here?

1509
01:19:16,754 --> 01:19:19,105
I'm speaking my piece, and you...

1510
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:21,983
Listen to me.

1511
01:19:22,969 --> 01:19:24,511
I...

1512
01:19:24,512 --> 01:19:27,055
We're... This kid on
trial here, his type...

1513
01:19:27,056 --> 01:19:29,157
Well, don't you know about them?

1514
01:19:31,018 --> 01:19:34,563
There's...
There's a danger here.

1515
01:19:34,564 --> 01:19:36,731
These people are dangerous.

1516
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:39,860
They're... wild.

1517
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:41,862
Listen to me.

1518
01:19:41,863 --> 01:19:44,281
- Listen.
- I have.

1519
01:19:44,282 --> 01:19:47,384
Now sit down and don't
open your mouth again.

1520
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:54,057
I was only trying to... tell you.

1521
01:20:30,453 --> 01:20:34,848
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1522
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:39,978
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1523
01:20:41,464 --> 01:20:43,924
I don't really know
what the truth is.

1524
01:20:43,925 --> 01:20:46,943
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1525
01:20:48,137 --> 01:20:52,182
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1526
01:20:52,183 --> 01:20:55,268
But we're just gambling
on probabilities.

1527
01:20:55,269 --> 01:20:57,312
We may be wrong.

1528
01:20:57,313 --> 01:20:59,773
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1529
01:20:59,774 --> 01:21:01,316
I don't know.

1530
01:21:01,317 --> 01:21:03,401
Nobody really can.

1531
01:21:03,402 --> 01:21:05,862
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1532
01:21:05,863 --> 01:21:09,449
and that's something that's
very valuable in our system.

1533
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:14,095
No jury can declare a man
guilty unless it's sure.

1534
01:21:15,456 --> 01:21:17,916
We nine can't understand...

1535
01:21:17,917 --> 01:21:20,727
how you three are still so sure.

1536
01:21:21,462 --> 01:21:23,563
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1537
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,426
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1538
01:21:28,427 --> 01:21:30,220
and I have two reasons.

1539
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:33,431
One, the evidence given by the
woman across the street...

1540
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:36,142
who actually saw the
murder committed.

1541
01:21:36,143 --> 01:21:38,812
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1542
01:21:38,813 --> 01:21:42,148
And two, the fact that she described
the stabbing by saying...

1543
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:47,862
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1544
01:21:47,863 --> 01:21:49,990
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1545
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:51,992
That's absolutely right.

1546
01:21:51,993 --> 01:21:54,661
Let's talk about this
woman for a moment.

1547
01:21:54,662 --> 01:21:57,831
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1548
01:21:57,832 --> 01:22:01,501
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1549
01:22:01,502 --> 01:22:05,672
and see directly into the
boy's room across the street.

1550
01:22:05,673 --> 01:22:08,383
She tossed and turned for over
an hour, unable to sleep.

1551
01:22:08,384 --> 01:22:12,637
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1552
01:22:12,638 --> 01:22:17,851
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1553
01:22:17,852 --> 01:22:20,645
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1554
01:22:20,646 --> 01:22:25,542
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1555
01:22:26,444 --> 01:22:30,380
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1556
01:22:31,032 --> 01:22:33,800
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1557
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:40,849
How about you?

1558
01:22:42,376 --> 01:22:44,919
I don't know.

1559
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,005
So much evidence to sift.

1560
01:22:47,006 --> 01:22:49,049
This is a pretty
complicated business.

1561
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:52,927
Frankly, I don't see how you
can vote for acquittal.

1562
01:22:52,928 --> 01:22:55,347
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1563
01:22:55,348 --> 01:22:57,474
You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1564
01:22:57,475 --> 01:23:01,144
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1565
01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:03,104
- Yeah, well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1566
01:23:03,105 --> 01:23:05,357
Okay. There's another
vote called for.

1567
01:23:05,358 --> 01:23:07,275
Anybody object?

1568
01:23:07,276 --> 01:23:10,403
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1569
01:23:10,404 --> 01:23:12,906
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1570
01:23:12,907 --> 01:23:16,576
Why is this such a personal
triumph for you... this one vote?

1571
01:23:16,577 --> 01:23:20,121
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1572
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:22,916
How about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1573
01:23:22,917 --> 01:23:25,518
You, you're the leader of
the cause. What about it?

1574
01:23:27,672 --> 01:23:29,589
Let's go over it again.

1575
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:31,591
We've been over it again!

1576
01:23:31,592 --> 01:23:34,170
The boy in the gray flannel
suit here is bouncin'

1577
01:23:34,171 --> 01:23:36,471
backwards and forwards
like a tennis ball.

1578
01:23:36,472 --> 01:23:40,408
No point in getting nasty and
trying to turn this into a contest.

1579
01:23:42,269 --> 01:23:43,812
Okay.

1580
01:23:43,813 --> 01:23:46,940
Maybe we can talk about setting
some kind of time limit.

1581
01:23:46,941 --> 01:23:49,167
Yeah, once around
for the deal, huh?

1582
01:23:49,777 --> 01:23:53,613
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1583
01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:55,657
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1584
01:23:55,658 --> 01:23:58,118
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1585
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:01,454
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1586
01:24:01,455 --> 01:24:03,223
Don't you feel well?

1587
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:06,501
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1588
01:24:06,502 --> 01:24:09,295
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1589
01:24:09,296 --> 01:24:12,298
Uh, the reason I asked about
that was because, uh...

1590
01:24:12,299 --> 01:24:13,967
you were rubbing your nose like...

1591
01:24:13,968 --> 01:24:16,720
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1592
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:20,014
but you made a gesture that
reminded me of something.

1593
01:24:20,015 --> 01:24:22,142
I'm trying to settle something
here. Do you mind?

1594
01:24:22,143 --> 01:24:24,244
Well, I think this is important.

1595
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:27,105
Thank you.

1596
01:24:27,106 --> 01:24:29,816
Now then, I'm sure you'll
pardon me for this...

1597
01:24:29,817 --> 01:24:32,819
but I was wondering why you were
rubbing your nose like that.

1598
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,571
Oh, come on, will ya?

1599
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:38,825
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1600
01:24:38,826 --> 01:24:42,162
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1601
01:24:42,163 --> 01:24:46,332
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1602
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,042
Oh. I'm sorry.

1603
01:24:48,043 --> 01:24:52,005
- Is it... Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1604
01:24:52,006 --> 01:24:53,840
Now can we get on
to something else?

1605
01:24:53,841 --> 01:24:58,511
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1606
01:24:58,512 --> 01:25:00,764
I hadn't noticed that before.

1607
01:25:00,765 --> 01:25:04,350
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1608
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:06,352
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1609
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:09,773
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1610
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:12,417
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1611
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:17,864
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1612
01:25:17,865 --> 01:25:21,509
had those same marks on
the sides of her nose.

1613
01:25:22,411 --> 01:25:24,704
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1614
01:25:24,705 --> 01:25:26,456
Please.

1615
01:25:26,457 --> 01:25:30,293
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1616
01:25:30,294 --> 01:25:33,213
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1617
01:25:33,214 --> 01:25:37,191
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1618
01:25:38,135 --> 01:25:40,345
in my mind.

1619
01:25:40,346 --> 01:25:42,447
She had those same marks.

1620
01:25:43,349 --> 01:25:47,619
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1621
01:25:48,562 --> 01:25:53,316
This woman was about, uh...
about 45 years old.

1622
01:25:53,317 --> 01:25:57,362
She was making a tremendous
effort to look 35...

1623
01:25:57,363 --> 01:25:59,656
for her first public appearance.

1624
01:25:59,657 --> 01:26:02,992
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1625
01:26:02,993 --> 01:26:06,955
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1626
01:26:06,956 --> 01:26:08,706
No glasses.

1627
01:26:08,707 --> 01:26:10,458
No, women do that.

1628
01:26:10,459 --> 01:26:12,961
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1629
01:26:12,962 --> 01:26:14,879
What do you mean, no glasses?

1630
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,674
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1631
01:26:17,675 --> 01:26:19,968
Now, she had those
marks. I saw 'em.

1632
01:26:19,969 --> 01:26:21,970
So what? What do ya
think that means?

1633
01:26:21,971 --> 01:26:24,238
Listen, I'm getting so sick
of your yelling in here!

1634
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:25,265
Come on. Forget it.

1635
01:26:25,266 --> 01:26:28,351
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1636
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:31,563
I was the closest one to her. She had these,
these things on the side of her nose.

1637
01:26:31,564 --> 01:26:34,858
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1638
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:38,820
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1639
01:26:38,821 --> 01:26:43,216
Could those marks be made by
anything other than eyeglasses?

1640
01:26:46,704 --> 01:26:49,122
No, they couldn't.

1641
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:51,224
I didn't see any marks!

1642
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:54,544
I did.

1643
01:26:54,545 --> 01:26:57,171
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1644
01:26:57,172 --> 01:26:59,382
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1645
01:26:59,383 --> 01:27:02,385
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1646
01:27:02,386 --> 01:27:04,554
Eleven of us didn't
think of it either.

1647
01:27:04,555 --> 01:27:07,807
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1648
01:27:07,808 --> 01:27:09,784
Have her testify
without her glasses?

1649
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:11,716
Did you ever see a woman who
had to wear glasses and

1650
01:27:11,717 --> 01:27:13,813
didn't want to because she
thinks they spoil her looks?

1651
01:27:13,814 --> 01:27:17,400
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1652
01:27:17,401 --> 01:27:21,154
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1653
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:25,408
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1654
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:30,079
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1655
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,373
That's all.

1656
01:27:32,374 --> 01:27:36,477
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1657
01:27:38,088 --> 01:27:40,089
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1658
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:43,176
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1659
01:27:43,177 --> 01:27:45,011
tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

1660
01:27:45,012 --> 01:27:47,430
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1661
01:27:47,431 --> 01:27:49,974
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1662
01:27:49,975 --> 01:27:52,185
when she turned to look
casually out of the window.

1663
01:27:52,186 --> 01:27:55,021
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1664
01:27:55,022 --> 01:27:56,481
The lights went off a
split second later.

1665
01:27:56,507 --> 01:27:58,149
She couldn't have had
time to put them on then.

1666
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:59,859
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1667
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:04,030
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1668
01:28:04,031 --> 01:28:07,700
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1669
01:28:07,701 --> 01:28:10,536
How do you know what kind of glasses
she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.

1670
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:13,247
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1671
01:28:13,248 --> 01:28:16,584
I only know the woman's
eyesight is in question now.

1672
01:28:16,585 --> 01:28:22,799
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1673
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,259
You can't send someone off to
die on evidence like that.

1674
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,345
Oh, don't give me that.

1675
01:28:27,346 --> 01:28:29,597
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1676
01:28:29,598 --> 01:28:32,100
- No.
- It's not possible?

1677
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:33,826
No, it's not possible.

1678
01:28:36,689 --> 01:28:38,706
Is it possible?

1679
01:28:39,733 --> 01:28:41,501
Not guilty.

1680
01:28:45,572 --> 01:28:48,324
Do you think he's guilty?

1681
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:50,426
I think he's guilty.

1682
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,847
Do you?

1683
01:28:57,626 --> 01:29:00,753
No. I'm convinced.

1684
01:29:00,754 --> 01:29:02,422
Not guilty.

1685
01:29:02,423 --> 01:29:04,298
What's the matter with you?

1686
01:29:04,299 --> 01:29:06,300
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1687
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:07,927
Eleven to one.

1688
01:29:07,928 --> 01:29:10,930
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1689
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:13,099
The knife, the whole business!

1690
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,119
Well, you said we could throw
out all the other evidence.

1691
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:24,043
Well, what do we do now?

1692
01:29:26,947 --> 01:29:28,698
You're alone.

1693
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:32,635
I don't care whether
I'm alone or not! It's my right.

1694
01:29:35,706 --> 01:29:37,974
It's your right.

1695
01:29:47,009 --> 01:29:49,527
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1696
01:29:51,055 --> 01:29:54,490
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1697
01:29:55,392 --> 01:29:57,602
We're not convinced.

1698
01:29:57,603 --> 01:30:00,480
We want to hear them again.

1699
01:30:00,481 --> 01:30:02,582
We have as much time as it takes.

1700
01:30:08,155 --> 01:30:12,700
Everything... Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...

1701
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:14,702
but I mean everything...
says he's guilty.

1702
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:17,263
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1703
01:30:18,832 --> 01:30:21,000
Why don't you take that
stuff about the old man?

1704
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:24,270
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1705
01:30:25,839 --> 01:30:27,590
Or this business about the knife.

1706
01:30:27,591 --> 01:30:29,675
What? 'Cause he found another
one exactly like it?

1707
01:30:29,676 --> 01:30:33,096
The old man saw him right
there on the stairs!

1708
01:30:33,097 --> 01:30:36,032
What's the difference how
many seconds it was?

1709
01:30:37,101 --> 01:30:39,202
Every single thing.

1710
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:43,773
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1711
01:30:43,774 --> 01:30:47,193
You can't prove he
didn't get to the door.

1712
01:30:47,194 --> 01:30:49,695
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1713
01:30:49,696 --> 01:30:52,381
But you can't prove it!

1714
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:57,912
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1715
01:30:57,913 --> 01:31:01,040
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1716
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:05,336
I'll bet ya $5,000 I'd
remember the movies I saw.

1717
01:31:05,337 --> 01:31:07,672
I'm telling ya, everything
that's gone on...

1718
01:31:07,673 --> 01:31:11,592
has been twisted and turned!

1719
01:31:11,593 --> 01:31:13,761
This business with the glasses?

1720
01:31:13,762 --> 01:31:19,392
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1721
01:31:19,393 --> 01:31:23,437
And what about hearing
the kid yell, huh?

1722
01:31:23,438 --> 01:31:26,791
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.

1723
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,835
Here. Ah...

1724
01:31:32,114 --> 01:31:34,715
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1725
01:31:41,832 --> 01:31:43,516
Well?

1726
01:31:45,711 --> 01:31:47,812
Say something!

1727
01:31:52,843 --> 01:31:56,529
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1728
01:31:57,097 --> 01:31:59,098
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1729
01:31:59,099 --> 01:32:01,701
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1730
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:09,375
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1731
01:32:14,114 --> 01:32:16,173
I can't keep...

1732
01:32:20,746 --> 01:32:22,513
No.

1733
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:28,227
Not guilty.

1734
01:32:31,506 --> 01:32:33,274
Not guilty.

1735
01:32:36,178 --> 01:32:37,887
Not...

1736
01:32:48,357 --> 01:32:50,624
Um, we're ready now.

1737
01:34:44,181 --> 01:34:45,948
Hey!

1738
01:34:50,187 --> 01:34:51,937
What's your name?

1739
01:34:51,938 --> 01:34:53,522
Davis.

1740
01:34:53,523 --> 01:34:55,541
My name's McCardle.

1741
01:34:57,778 --> 01:34:59,528
Well, so long.

1742
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:01,130
So long.
