1
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,126
<i>When I was lying there in the VA hospital,</i>

2
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:45,129
<i>with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,</i>

3
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,424
<i>I started having these dreams of flying.</i>

4
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,261
<i>I was free.</i>

5
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:58,059
<i>Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.</i>

6
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,780
<i>They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,</i>

7
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:13,616
<i>but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.</i>

8
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,829
<i>A VA check and 12 bucks
will get you a cup of coffee.</i>

9
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,665
<i>I'm what they call... waitlisted.</i>

10
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:34,220
<i>The Bengal Tiger, extinct for over
a century is making a comeback.</i>

11
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:38,558
<i>These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
are the latest of a number of species</i>

12
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,478
<i>that have been cloned back
into existence in the past five years.</i>

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,775
<i>I became a marine for the hardship.
To be hammered on the anvil of life.</i>

14
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,488
<i>I told myself I can pass
any test a man can pass.</i>

15
00:01:55,366 --> 00:02:00,830
Jake!Jake!Jake!Jake!Jake!

16
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:06,669
<i>Let's get it straight, upfront.</i>

17
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,171
<i>I don't want your pity.</i>

18
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,425
<i>You want a fair deal,
you're on the wrong planet.</i>

19
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:18,848
<i>The strong prey on the weak.</i>

20
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,267
<i>That's just the way things are.</i>

21
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:24,646
<i>And nobody does a damn thing.</i>

22
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,165
Get Off! Get Off Of him!

23
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:49,420
<i>All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
was a single thing worth fighting for.</i>

24
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,604
I hope you realized you just lost
yourself a customer.

25
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,358
Candy-ass bitch.

26
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,737
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

27
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,795
- It doesn't look like him.
-lt's him.

28
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,131
You Jake Sully?

29
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,466
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

30
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,510
It's about your brother.

31
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,769
We're looking for Sully, T.

32
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:49,772
In there.

33
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,465
Jesus, Tommy.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,675
<i>The strong prey on the weak.</i>

35
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,928
<i>A guy with a knife took all
Tommy would ever be</i>

36
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,598
<i>for the paper in his wallet.</i>

37
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,769
<i>The concern of the suits was touching.</i>

38
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:31,355
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

39
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,900
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

40
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:38,446
And since your genome is identical
to his, you could step into his shoes,

41
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,032
so to speak.

42
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,744
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

43
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:48,706
You could do something important.
You can make a difference.

44
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,880
And the pay is good.

45
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,507
Very good.

46
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:00,635
<i>Tommy was the scientist, not me.</i>

47
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,721
<i>He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space</i>

48
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,097
<i>to find the answers.</i>

49
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:13,898
<i>Me, I was just another dumb grunt getting
sent someplace he was gonna regret.</i>

50
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,849
<i>In cryo, you don't dream at all.</i>

51
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,060
<i>It doesn't feel like six years.</i>

52
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:54,438
<i>More like a fifth of tequila
and an ass-kicking.</i>

53
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,120
Are we there yet?

54
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,455
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

55
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,374
We're there.

56
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,628
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

57
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,506
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

58
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,678
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks
provided for your convenience.

59
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,973
The staff thanks you in advance.

60
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,655
<i>Up ahead was Pandora.</i>

61
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:49,994
<i>You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.</i>

62
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,766
<i>Valkyrie 1-6, copy...</i>

63
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,603
<i>Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear
for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.</i>

64
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:20,191
Copy, Venture Star. Go for
de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

65
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,672
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

66
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,090
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

67
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,885
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

68
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:51,263
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

69
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,726
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

70
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,603
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

71
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,398
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

72
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,943
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

73
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:49,989
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

74
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,616
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

75
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:03,002
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

76
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,181
<i>There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.</i>

77
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,268
<i>You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.</i>

78
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,823
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

79
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,658
Well, well, ladies.

80
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,828
Look at all this fresh meat!

81
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,838
<i>Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,</i>

82
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,465
<i>fighting for freedom.</i>

83
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,681
<i>Look out, hot rod!</i>

84
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,018
<i>But out here they're just hired guns,</i>

85
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,979
<i>taking the money,
working for the company.</i>

86
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,439
Check this out, man.

87
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,525
Meals on wheels.

88
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,737
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

89
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,697
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

90
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,324
Got it! Need them!

91
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,877
<i>You're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

92
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:33,217
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,054
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

94
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,933
If there is a hell,

95
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:46,313
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

96
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,316
Out there, beyond that fence,

97
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,737
every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

98
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,991
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

99
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:03,706
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

100
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,083
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

101
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,003
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

102
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:13,382
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

103
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,843
They are very hard to kill.

104
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:21,307
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

105
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,019
I will not succeed.

106
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,606
Not with all of you.

107
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,734
If you wish to survive,

108
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,695
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

109
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,698
You've got to obey the rules.

110
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,492
Pandora rules.

111
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,454
Rule number one...

112
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,247
<i>There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief</i>

113
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,999
<i>to put your mind at ease.</i>

114
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:54,882
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

115
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,801
Wow! You look just like him.

116
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:01,639
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

117
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,724
...into the bio-lab.

118
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:08,979
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

119
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,314
- Hi.
- Hey.

120
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,982
Link... Here's the link room right here.

121
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,360
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

122
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,280
<i>Me and Norm are here to drive</i>

123
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,492
<i>these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.</i>

124
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:26,580
<i>And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.</i>

125
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,624
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

126
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,085
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

127
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,964
Damn! They got big.

128
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,591
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

129
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:40,010
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

130
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,971
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

131
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,973
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

132
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:45,933
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

133
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,810
There's yours.

134
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,146
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

135
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,066
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

136
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,466
Looks like him.

137
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,553
No, it looks like you.

138
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,597
This is your avatar now, Jake.

139
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:33,230
<i>And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,</i>

140
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,108
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

141
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,944
or something.

142
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,700
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

143
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,619
which is insanely expensive.

144
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,832
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

145
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,084
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

146
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,211
You know, what we see, what we feel.

147
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,006
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

148
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,550
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

149
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,386
All right. Whatever.

150
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,015
So...

151
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,517
Well, here I am,

152
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,687
doing science.

153
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,440
They're coming out!

154
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,026
<i>Attention. Drivers coming out of link.</i>

155
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,701
Oh, God.

156
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,371
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

157
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:37,753
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

158
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,299
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

159
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,885
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

160
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,763
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

161
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,057
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

162
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,434
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

163
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,230
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

164
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,693
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

165
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,670
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

166
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,258
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

167
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,970
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

168
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,471
He's dead.

169
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,516
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

170
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,937
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

171
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,525
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

172
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,986
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

173
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,320
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

174
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,948
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

175
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,449
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

176
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,411
He has no business
sticking his nose in my department.

177
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:57,249
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

178
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,511
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

179
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,389
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

180
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,479
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

181
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,648
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

182
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,651
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

183
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,825
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

184
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,870
but now I see
that you're intentionally screwing me.

185
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,457
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

186
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,340
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

187
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,008
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

188
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,676
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

189
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,720
How is this in any way lucky?

190
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,555
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

191
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,558
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

192
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,560
A Marine we can use.

193
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,562
I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

194
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,024
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

195
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,068
Look, look,
you're supposed to be winning the hearts

196
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,194
and the minds of the natives.

197
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,071
Isn't that the whole point of
your little puppet show?

198
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,697
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

199
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,407
then they'll start trusting us.

200
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,534
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

201
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,578
but after, what, how many years?

202
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,247
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

203
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,583
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

204
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,710
Right. Come here.

205
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,546
I can't... I can't...

206
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,761
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

207
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,931
Because this little gray rock sells
for 20 million a kilo.

208
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,226
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

209
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,228
It's what pays for your science.

210
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,774
Now, those savages
are threatening our whole operation,

211
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,109
we're on the brink of war,

212
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,404
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

213
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,949
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

214
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,421
So, how much link time have you logged?

215
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:11,133
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

216
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:15,512
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

217
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,265
Zip. But I read a manual.

218
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,268
Tell me you're joking.

219
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,979
This is cool.

220
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,856
Let's go.

221
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,486
Don't. I got this.

222
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,493
So you just figured you'd come out here,

223
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,121
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

224
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,958
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

225
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,377
What was going through your head?

226
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,297
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

227
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,675
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

228
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:58,430
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

229
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:03,310
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

230
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,979
That shouldn't be hard for you.

231
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,814
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

232
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,358
Initiate link.

233
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,694
Run sequence unit three. Go.

234
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,154
Launching.

235
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,078
I have the first congruency.

236
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:35,050
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

237
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,052
Phase-lock 40%.

238
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,599
All right. Going in.

239
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,810
I'm going in in four.

240
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,482
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

241
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,253
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

242
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,879
Pupillary reflex is good.

243
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,677
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

244
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,762
Hey, guys.

245
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,432
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

246
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:24,891
Good!

247
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,393
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

248
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,603
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

249
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,063
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

250
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,731
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

251
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,984
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

252
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,402
-that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

253
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,405
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

254
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,992
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

255
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,827
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

256
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,415
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

257
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,168
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

258
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,795
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

259
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,131
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

260
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,800
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

261
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,969
-so take it easy.
- Wait.

262
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,471
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

263
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,931
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

264
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,267
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

265
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,144
- Buddy, listen to me.
-lt's all good. I got this.

266
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,939
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

267
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,150
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

268
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,986
You need time to adjust to the avatar...
Whoa! Jake!

269
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,322
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

270
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:24,493
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand
milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

271
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,870
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

272
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:27,954
<i>By the numbers.</i>

273
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,456
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me.

274
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,124
You're not used to your avatar body.

275
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,959
<i>- This is dangerous.
- This is great.</i>

276
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,254
<i>- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're</i> gonna <i>put you out.</i>

277
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,468
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

278
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,136
God damn it! Bring them home!

279
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,889
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

280
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:51,478
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

281
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,146
I don't even have to play defense on it.

282
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,731
Hey, guys. Hey.

283
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,150
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!

284
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,985
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

285
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,156
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

286
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,658
Come on!

287
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,662
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

288
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,590
<i>- Jeez!</i> Sorry.
<i>- Watch it!</i>

289
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,364
Hey, Marine!

290
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,616
Damn.

291
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,830
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

292
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,583
Think fast.

293
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,586
Motor control's looking good.

294
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,808
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

295
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,060
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

296
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,562
Hey, hey, hey!

297
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,273
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

298
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,899
That's kind of freaky.

299
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,402
Come on. Scat.

300
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,738
Good night.

301
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,576
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

302
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,643
Welcome back.

303
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,944
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

304
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:11,951
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

305
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,162
Hold on a second.

306
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,624
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

307
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:22,170
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, <i>capitaine!</i>

308
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,839
Vine strike's still loose.

309
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,175
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

310
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,551
Watch it!

311
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,846
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

312
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,682
Or the biggest.

313
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:36,518
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

314
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,436
I thought you'd never ask.

315
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,941
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

316
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,037
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

317
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,748
This low gravity'll make you soft.

318
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,710
You get soft,

319
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:08,258
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

320
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,886
I pulled your record, Corporal.

321
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,389
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

322
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,685
Nothing like this here, though.

323
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,357
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

324
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,276
I figured it's just another hellhole.

325
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,778
I was First Recon myself.

326
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,073
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

327
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,952
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

328
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,495
I come out here?

329
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,541
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

330
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:46,212
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

331
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,968
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

332
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,888
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

333
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,812
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

334
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:09,903
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

335
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,571
- Clear!
- Clear!

336
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:21,956
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

337
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,625
Give me the goose bumps.

338
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,128
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

339
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,922
right on the ground.

340
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,133
Right in the hostiles' camp.

341
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:38,264
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

342
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,099
I want you to gain their trust.

343
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,935
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

344
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,479
or hammer them hard if they won't.

345
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,274
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

346
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:52,445
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

347
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,532
but you report to me.

348
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,743
Can you do that for me, son?

349
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,663
Hell, yeah, sir.

350
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,374
Well, all right, then.

351
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,346
Son, I take care of my own.

352
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:19,472
You get me what I need,

353
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,809
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

354
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,186
Your real legs.

355
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,983
That sounds real good, sir.

356
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,325
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

357
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:43,037
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

358
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:46,666
I have five congruencies. Phase-lock 90%.

359
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,084
Link three ready.

360
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,420
All right, I'm going in.

361
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,579
Sturmbeest herd
coming up on your right.

362
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,456
Got it! Thanks.

363
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,044
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows
and some juveniles.

364
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,511
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

365
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:28,768
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

366
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:35,400
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

367
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,487
You the man, Doc.

368
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:19,193
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

369
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:25,241
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

370
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,416
So, how will they know we're here?

371
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,169
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

372
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,258
This was our school.

373
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,595
Now it's just...storage.

374
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,347
The kids were so bright.

375
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,266
Eager to learn.

376
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,852
They picked up English
faster than I could teach it.

377
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:57,273
So, we'll take a couple of
these Ph monitors...

378
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,484
...and a soil probe.

379
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:05,031
That little yellow case back there.
The old microscope.

380
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,158
Here.

381
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,826
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

382
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,037
The stingbats knocked them down.

383
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:22,340
I keep hoping someone will
come back in and read them.

384
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,133
Why don't they come back?

385
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:32,225
The Omaticaya...learned as much
about us as they needed to.

386
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,564
What happened here?

387
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,530
Are you going to help us with this gear?
We've got a lot to do.

388
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,088
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

389
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:08,094
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

390
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:13,683
Wow! It's that fast?

391
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,020
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

392
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:21,899
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

393
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:25,611
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

394
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:27,363
Okay. Sample.

395
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:33,703
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

396
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,332
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

397
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,585
Right.

398
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,239
So, here I go.

399
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:39,560
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

400
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,899
It's already pissed off.

401
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:48,027
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

402
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:57,954
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

403
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,373
So, what do I do, dance with it?

404
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,918
Just hold your ground.

405
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,394
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

406
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,480
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

407
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,900
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

408
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:32,029
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

409
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:35,032
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

410
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:38,119
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

411
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,331
Oh, shit.

412
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,637
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

413
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,099
Run! Definitely run!

414
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,868
<i>I'm gonna have to call it, guys.</i>

415
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:50,871
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

416
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,918
<i>I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to
hang on till morning.</i>

417
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,544
He won't make it till morning.

418
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,409
I don't have all goddamn night.

419
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,329
Come on! Come on!

420
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:10,904
Hey, wait. Don't!

421
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:15,534
Great.

422
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:16,553
Look, I know you probably don't
understand this,

423
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:23,894
but thank you.

424
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:30,484
Thank you.

425
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:35,948
That was pretty impressive.

426
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:41,620
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was...

427
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:48,293
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

428
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,754
Wait up!

429
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:53,340
Just... Hey, slow down.

430
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,426
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

431
00:43:57,511 --> 00:44:00,556
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

432
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,850
You don't thank for this.

433
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:09,356
This is sad. Very sad only.

434
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:12,359
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

435
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:15,028
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

436
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:21,702
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

437
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:24,621
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

438
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,373
Your fault!

439
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:29,543
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

440
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:33,380
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

441
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,881
Easy.

442
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:39,553
Fine. Fine.

443
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:42,848
If you love your little forest friends,

444
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,226
why not let them just kill my ass?

445
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,021
What's the thinking?

446
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:52,524
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

447
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,905
You have a strong heart.

448
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:02,242
No fear.

449
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,625
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

450
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:18,467
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

451
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,345
Look, maybe you should teach me.

452
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:23,639
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

453
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,641
Well, then teach me how to See.

454
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,185
- No one can teach you to See.
- Whoa.

455
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:31,938
Look, come on, can't we talk?

456
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:36,777
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

457
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:43,325
You're like a baby.

458
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:51,124
I need your help.

459
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,086
You should not be here.

460
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,839
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

461
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:01,551
No.

462
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:04,304
Go back.

463
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:26,952
No!

464
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:49,933
What...

465
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:55,188
What are they?

466
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:58,525
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

467
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:01,236
Very pure spirits.

468
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,304
What was that all about?

469
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,515
Come.

470
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,059
Come!

471
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,563
Where are we going?

472
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,158
Come.

473
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,050
What's your name?

474
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,218
Shit!

475
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,828
Okay.

476
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:06,778
What's going on?

477
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,240
Wait.

478
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,828
What's happening?

479
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:16,705
Hey!

480
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,682
What's he saying?

481
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,686
Hey, what's he saying?

482
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:04,938
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

483
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,526
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

484
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,663
That is Mother.

485
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:25,667
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

486
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:27,877
Who's Eywa?

487
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:36,469
What are you called?

488
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:38,763
Jake Sully.

489
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,484
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

490
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:55,822
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

491
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:59,242
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

492
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:03,079
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

493
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,958
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

494
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,501
What are you?

495
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,965
I was a Marine. A...

496
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:17,469
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

497
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:52,378
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

498
00:52:52,462 --> 00:52:56,049
Learn well, Jakesully.

499
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,637
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

500
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,824
Good evening.

501
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,662
Please don't get up.

502
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:28,832
Excuse me.

503
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,335
Sorry.

504
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,131
Hey, how you doing?

505
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:46,724
Thank you.

506
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:51,604
You know, I don't
even know your name.

507
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,732
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

508
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:58,945
Again, a whole lot slower?

509
00:53:58,987 --> 00:54:00,280
Neytiri.

510
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,990
Neytili.

511
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,284
Neytiri.

512
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,661
Neytiri.

513
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:09,664
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

514
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,541
It's nice.

515
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,669
<i>- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha.</i>

516
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:59,797
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake.Jake!

517
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:04,677
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

518
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:09,015
There you go. There you go, there you go.

519
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,476
You're okay. You're okay.

520
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,479
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

521
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:20,109
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

522
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,947
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

523
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:27,951
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

524
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:32,163
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

525
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:35,166
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

526
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,627
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

527
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:40,964
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

528
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:43,800
"Jarhead clan"?

529
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:48,429
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.

530
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:53,017
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

531
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,686
That's called taking the initiative, son.

532
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:57,230
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully. Sully.

533
00:55:57,313 --> 00:56:00,733
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

534
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:07,323
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

535
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,158
But no, no, no, they like mud.

536
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:13,204
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

537
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:16,833
Hey, can you... Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

538
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,838
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

539
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:24,048
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

540
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:30,221
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

541
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:35,601
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

542
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:41,858
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.

543
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:47,321
- What if they won't go?
-l'm betting that they will.

544
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:50,533
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

545
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,203
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

546
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:58,041
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

547
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:01,377
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

548
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:04,589
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

549
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,426
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

550
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,722
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

551
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,807
Well, we're wasting time.

552
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:16,893
I like this guy.

553
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,563
- Guys, right now...
- Okay, let's run through them again.

554
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,899
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

555
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,904
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

556
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:31,157
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

557
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,825
Got it.

558
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:35,119
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

559
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:37,914
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

560
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,418
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

561
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:44,504
They become a mated pair.

562
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:47,757
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

563
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:52,261
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

564
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:53,721
Everything they know!

565
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:55,890
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

566
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,350
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

567
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,102
Come on. That's...

568
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:01,771
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten
around here.

569
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,818
Neytiri was my best student.

570
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,904
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

571
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,406
Just amazing girls.

572
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,075
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

573
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,035
She's dead.

574
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:22,458
Let's go. Village life starts early.

575
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:27,171
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

576
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:47,692
Easy, boy.

577
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,403
Pale is female.

578
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,783
Okay. Easy, girl.

579
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:28,316
<i>That is shahaylu. The</i> bond.

580
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:31,736
Feel her.

581
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:38,993
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

582
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,789
Feel her strong legs.

583
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,586
You may tell her what to do.

584
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:49,879
Inside.

585
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:53,758
For now, say where to go.

586
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:58,012
Forward!

587
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,741
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.

588
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,453
I knew you could speak English.

589
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:41,847
Again.

590
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:45,434
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

591
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,937
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

592
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,147
There's an outer row of columns.

593
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,984
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

594
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:56,612
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

595
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:59,115
That's how they move up and down.

596
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:02,118
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

597
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:03,494
Roger that.

598
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,288
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

599
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:09,125
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

600
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:17,133
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

601
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:22,680
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

602
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,017
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

603
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,060
way up in the mountains.

604
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:31,188
The Hallelujah Mountains?

605
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,482
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

606
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,526
- Yeah.
- Yes!

607
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:42,658
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

608
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:58,049
We're getting close.

609
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,843
Yeah, look at my instruments.

610
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,888
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

611
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:06,223
We're VFR from here on.

612
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,184
What's VF R?

613
01:02:08,184 --> 01:02:10,561
Means you gotta see where you're going.

614
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:14,565
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

615
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:35,711
Oh, my God.

616
01:02:46,722 --> 01:02:48,099
You should see your faces.

617
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,545
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

618
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:33,269
<i>So what does hold them up?</i>

619
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,812
<i>Grace explained it to me.</i>

620
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:37,481
<i>Some kind of maglev effect.</i>

621
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:41,402
<i>Because unobtanium is
a superconductor...or something.</i>

622
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:05,551
Welcome to camp.

623
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:14,059
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

624
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,396
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

625
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:21,025
<i>- Grace didn't miss</i> a <i>thing.
- Trudy, you'll</i> take <i>the top one.</i>

626
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:23,527
<i>She knew I was talking to the Colonel.</i>

627
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:27,239
<i>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,</i>

628
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:28,866
<i>so she's playing nice.</i>

629
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:34,038
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

630
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:41,003
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

631
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:31,553
Holy shit!

632
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,348
Do not look in her eye.

633
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,608
Ikran is not horse.

634
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:47,611
<i>Once shahaylu is made,</i>

635
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:55,828
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life.

636
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:08,507
To become taronyu, hunter,

637
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:12,177
you must choose your own <i>ikran</i>
and he must choose you.

638
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,765
- When?
- When you are ready.

639
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:10,319
Okay. This is video log 12.

640
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,197
Time's 2132.

641
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:18,035
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.

642
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:20,913
No, now. When it's fresh.

643
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,417
Okay, location, shack,

644
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:28,712
and the days are starting to blur together.

645
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:34,093
<i>The language is a pain, but, you know,</i>

646
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:37,304
<i>I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition.</i>

647
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:39,056
<i>- Navi.
-"Nari. "</i>

648
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:41,392
<i>- Nari.
-"Narrri"!</i>

649
01:07:41,392 --> 01:07:42,684
<i>Narrri!</i>

650
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,646
<i>Txur ni'ul. Stronger.</i>

651
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:53,904
<i>Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.</i>

652
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,741
This is a very important part of it.

653
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,952
<i>- Norm's attitude has improved lately.</i>
- I <i>see</i> you. I <i>see you.</i>

654
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,413
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

655
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:04,081
it's "I see into you. I See you."

656
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,834
<i>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.</i>

657
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,169
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

658
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:12,464
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

659
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:16,844
<i>My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.</i>

660
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,849
<i>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.</i>

661
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:28,689
Yeah! Check it out!

662
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,774
Oh, crap!

663
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:39,950
<i>Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,</i>

664
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,202
<i>the tiniest scents and sounds.</i>

665
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:52,546
<i>She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.</i>

666
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:56,008
<i>I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final.</i>

667
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:59,803
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

668
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:02,514
You need to listen to what she says.

669
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:05,809
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

670
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,437
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

671
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,413
<i>With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.</i>

672
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,833
You gotta be kidding me.

673
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,906
<i>L talked Mo'at into
letting Grace into the village.</i>

674
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:04,660
<i>It's the first time
since her school was closed down.</i>

675
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,317
Come on, Marine.

676
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:05,262
<i>I'm trying to understand
this deep connection</i>

677
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:07,556
<i>the people have to the forest.</i>

678
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:10,851
<i>She talks about a network of energy</i>

679
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:14,271
<i>that flows through all living things.</i>

680
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:18,483
<i>She says all energy is only borrowed,</i>

681
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:21,987
<i>and one day you have to give it back.</i>

682
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:05,530
You were in 16 hours today.

683
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,410
You're still losing weight.

684
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:16,583
No, you don't.

685
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,378
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Come back here.

686
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,048
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

687
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:26,968
Today I made a kill.

688
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:30,764
And we ate it. At least,
I know where that meal came from.

689
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:35,268
Other body. You need to
take care of this body. Okay?

690
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,062
- Get it? Let's eat it.
- Yeah, yeah.

691
01:12:37,646 --> 01:12:40,065
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

692
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:42,359
Give it to me.

693
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:43,944
- You look like crap.
- Thank you.

694
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,779
You're burning way too hard.

695
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,699
Get rid of this shit.

696
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,701
And then you can lecture me.

697
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:54,496
Now, I'm telling you,
as your boss,

698
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:59,292
and as someone who might even
consider being a friend someday

699
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:01,795
to take some down time.

700
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,630
Eat this, please.

701
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:08,385
Trust me, I...
learned the hard way.

702
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:25,569
What did happen at the school, Grace?

703
01:13:33,744 --> 01:13:39,374
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin,
stopped coming to school.

704
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,501
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

705
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:46,882
And one day, she and a couple of
other young hunters came running in

706
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:50,093
all painted up.

707
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:52,804
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

708
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:59,019
I guess they thought
I could protect them.

709
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:04,649
The troopers pursued them
to the school.

710
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:08,028
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

711
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,405
Right in front of Neytiri.

712
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:11,656
And then shot the others.

713
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:15,952
I got most of the kids out.

714
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:21,625
But they never came back.

715
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:26,463
I'm sorry.

716
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:38,850
A scientist stays objective.

717
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:43,563
We can't be ruled by emotion.

718
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:46,817
But I put 10 years of my life
into that school.

719
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:50,570
They called me sa'nok.

720
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:53,657
Mother.

721
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:54,741
Mother.

722
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,581
That kind of pain
reaches back through the link.

723
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:48,628
A clean kill.

724
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,466
You are ready.

725
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:22,495
<i>Learning to ride an 'man,
we call them banshees,</i>

726
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,165
<i>is the test every young hunter has to pass.</i>

727
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:30,712
<i>But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are.</i>

728
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:32,756
Oo-rah.

729
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,497
Now what?

730
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:55,565
Jakesully will go first.

731
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:32,435
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside.

732
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:36,314
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

733
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:39,275
You will have one chance, Jake.

734
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,444
How will I know if he chooses me?

735
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:43,488
He will try to kill you.

736
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:46,074
Outstanding.

737
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,760
Let's dance.

738
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:23,087
Make the bond!

739
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,425
No!

740
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,513
Jake!

741
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,154
<i>Shahaylu,</i> Jake.

742
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:51,783
<i>Shahaylu!</i>

743
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:03,002
Stop!

744
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:16,724
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

745
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:32,907
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

746
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,577
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

747
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:46,462
God damn!

748
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:52,135
Oh, shit!

749
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,771
Shut up and fly straight!

750
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:16,367
That's it. Bank left!

751
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:27,462
Level out! That's it.

752
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,302
Jakesully!

753
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:00,161
Hey!

754
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,502
Let's go!

755
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:21,849
Yeah, baby, I got this!

756
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:23,935
Oh, shit!

757
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:32,985
<i>I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.</i>

758
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,904
Yeah!

759
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:39,033
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

760
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:44,038
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
- Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

761
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,102
<i>The Tree of Souls.</i>

762
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,733
It's their most sacred place.

763
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:57,320
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

764
01:25:57,403 --> 01:25:59,488
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

765
01:25:59,572 --> 01:26:04,118
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

766
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,580
I would die to get samples.

767
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:11,000
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

768
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,418
You lucky swine.

769
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:34,875
Hell, yeah!

770
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:36,502
Hell, yeah!

771
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:53,019
<i>I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.</i>

772
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,356
<i>Only problem is, you're not the only one.</i>

773
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,403
Dive!

774
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,385
Go, go!

775
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,895
Follow me!

776
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:24,944
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

777
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:28,864
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

778
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:33,744
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

779
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:42,128
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.

780
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:44,588
Rider of Last Shadow.

781
01:29:45,965 --> 01:29:47,424
He rode this?

782
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:50,678
<i>Toruk</i> chose him.

783
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:54,890
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

784
01:29:54,974 --> 01:29:56,976
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

785
01:29:57,685 --> 01:29:59,562
<i>Toruk Macto</i> was mighty.

786
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:05,234
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

787
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:07,570
All Na'vi people know the story.

788
01:30:14,285 --> 01:30:18,497
<i>Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world</i>

789
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,625
<i>and in here is the dream.</i>

790
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:45,024
<i>It's hard to believe
it's only been three months.</i>

791
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:50,529
I can barely remember my old life.

792
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,910
I don't know who I am anymore.

793
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:17,514
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

794
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:23,604
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

795
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:28,317
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

796
01:31:30,903 --> 01:31:33,489
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

797
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:35,366
No, I can do this.

798
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:37,076
You already have.

799
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:40,287
You give me good, usable intel.

800
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,498
This Tree of Souls place.

801
01:31:42,957 --> 01:31:46,335
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

802
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,170
which it Will. Yeah.

803
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:51,131
Now it's time to come in.

804
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:54,468
By the way,

805
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:56,971
you gonna get your legs back.

806
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:01,517
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

807
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:03,978
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

808
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:05,854
I'm a man of my word.

809
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:10,526
I gotta finish this.

810
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:14,363
There's one more thing.

811
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:20,035
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

812
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:24,665
If I do it, I'm one of them.

813
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,960
And they'll trust me.

814
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:34,800
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

815
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:50,899
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

816
01:33:08,334 --> 01:33:12,338
<i>The Na 'vi say
that every person is born twice.</i>

817
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:19,762
<i>The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever.</i>

818
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:22,324
Come. Come.

819
01:34:39,967 --> 01:34:42,678
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

820
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:46,181
And sometimes answered.

821
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,733
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

822
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,486
The Tree of Voices.

823
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:03,657
The voices of our ancestors.

824
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:20,257
I can hear them.

825
01:35:25,179 --> 01:35:26,805
They live, Jake,

826
01:35:28,849 --> 01:35:30,267
within Eywa.

827
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:36,315
You are Omaticaya now.

828
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:40,152
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

829
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,743
And you may choose a woman.

830
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:51,830
We have many fine women.

831
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,042
Ninat is the best singer.

832
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,838
But I don't want Ninat.

833
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:06,094
Beyral is a good hunter.

834
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:09,848
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

835
01:36:11,934 --> 01:36:13,685
I've already chosen.

836
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:19,691
But this woman must also choose me.

837
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,322
She already has.

838
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,712
I am with you now, Jake.

839
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:25,132
<i>We are mated for life.</i>

840
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,473
<i>What the hell are you doing, Jake?</i>

841
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,047
Ma Jake!

842
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,423
Don't forget your phase integration.

843
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:07,841
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

844
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:09,843
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

845
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:23,231
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

846
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:26,360
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

847
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,112
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

848
01:38:32,908 --> 01:38:34,034
Jake!

849
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,044
Okay.

850
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,224
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

851
01:38:57,224 --> 01:38:59,559
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

852
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,645
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

853
01:39:05,774 --> 01:39:07,067
Jake!

854
01:39:13,824 --> 01:39:18,745
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

855
01:39:22,249 --> 01:39:23,583
Hey!

856
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:26,753
Stop! Stop!

857
01:39:26,753 --> 01:39:29,589
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

858
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,095
Hey, boss.

859
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:36,763
Hey!

860
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:40,434
- What?
- I got a native

861
01:39:40,517 --> 01:39:43,478
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

862
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:46,690
Well, keep going. He'll move.

863
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:50,026
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

864
01:39:52,362 --> 01:39:54,573
Stop! Hey!

865
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:56,950
Go! Go!

866
01:39:57,951 --> 01:39:59,411
There, see? He moved.

867
01:40:11,798 --> 01:40:14,676
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

868
01:40:14,676 --> 01:40:15,677
I'm blind.

869
01:40:27,606 --> 01:40:29,858
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

870
01:40:31,443 --> 01:40:33,111
Here, come on!

871
01:40:58,011 --> 01:41:00,597
Freeze it right there.

872
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:04,643
Scale up. Enhance.

873
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:07,812
Son of a bitch.

874
01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:10,774
Unbelievable.

875
01:41:11,858 --> 01:41:13,985
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

876
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:36,258
You do not speak here!

877
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:49,187
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

878
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:53,858
- You!
- Listen. Brother...

879
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:02,492
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.

880
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:05,745
Is this true?

881
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:10,458
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

882
01:42:11,835 --> 01:42:13,003
Brother, please.

883
01:42:13,086 --> 01:42:16,923
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

884
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:19,259
You are not my brother!

885
01:42:22,429 --> 01:42:24,222
And I am not your enemy!

886
01:42:25,849 --> 01:42:28,727
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

887
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,772
Go! Go! Go!

888
01:42:35,984 --> 01:42:38,486
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

889
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:39,904
Tsu'tey!

890
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:49,039
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

891
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:52,083
And I have the right to speak.

892
01:43:06,431 --> 01:43:08,516
The words are like stones in my heart.

893
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:14,856
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

894
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:17,150
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

895
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:19,653
It's very dangerous!

896
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,448
Grace!

897
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:25,867
Oh, no.

898
01:43:26,076 --> 01:43:28,078
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

899
01:43:29,579 --> 01:43:31,831
Okay. Look...

900
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:34,250
I was sent here to...

901
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:05,198
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

902
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,829
Wheel this meat out of here.

903
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:15,083
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

904
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:20,130
You let me down, son.

905
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:23,383
So, what,

906
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,928
you find yourself some local tail

907
01:44:26,928 --> 01:44:30,140
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

908
01:44:30,223 --> 01:44:32,726
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

909
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:35,395
- Parker...
- Shut your pie hole!

910
01:44:35,395 --> 01:44:39,607
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

911
01:44:39,691 --> 01:44:42,444
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

912
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:45,280
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

913
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:47,907
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

914
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:49,951
You start by listening to her.

915
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:52,328
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

916
01:44:52,412 --> 01:44:54,247
-in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

917
01:44:54,247 --> 01:44:56,624
You throw a stick in the air around here,

918
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:59,627
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

919
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:01,129
-for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

920
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:05,633
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

921
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:08,303
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

922
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:09,888
Which is what, exactly?

923
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:12,307
What we think we know

924
01:45:12,307 --> 01:45:15,769
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

925
01:45:15,769 --> 01:45:20,190
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

926
01:45:20,273 --> 01:45:24,861
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

927
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:28,114
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

928
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:31,326
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

929
01:45:31,326 --> 01:45:33,745
It's more connections
than the human brain.

930
01:45:34,913 --> 01:45:37,499
Get it? It's a network.

931
01:45:37,499 --> 01:45:40,543
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

932
01:45:40,627 --> 01:45:44,172
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

933
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:46,925
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

934
01:45:47,509 --> 01:45:48,593
Yes!

935
01:45:49,803 --> 01:45:53,932
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

936
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:56,643
They're just goddamn trees!

937
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:01,189
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

938
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:05,693
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

939
01:46:05,777 --> 01:46:09,489
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

940
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:13,868
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

941
01:46:13,952 --> 01:46:18,665
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

942
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:22,836
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

943
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:25,171
<i>They're not gonna give up their home.</i>

944
01:46:26,965 --> 01:46:28,633
<i>They're not gonna make a deal.</i>

945
01:46:29,676 --> 01:46:31,970
<i>For what? Lite beer?</i>

946
01:46:32,554 --> 01:46:34,097
<i>And blue jeans?</i>

947
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:40,228
<i>There's nothing that we have
that they want.</i>

948
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:45,191
<i>Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time.</i>

949
01:46:50,113 --> 01:46:51,531
<i>They're never gonna leave Hometree.</i>

950
01:46:54,409 --> 01:47:00,415
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

951
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:05,128
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

952
01:47:05,169 --> 01:47:07,797
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

953
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:35,199
Talk to me, Lyle.

954
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:38,077
<i>It looks like they hit it
with banshees first.</i>

955
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:39,871
<i>See the angle's steep?</i>

956
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:46,127
<i>They set the ampsuit on fire.</i>

957
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:47,712
<i>Driver's toast.</i>

958
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:50,965
The rest of the squad?

959
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:55,053
<i>Six bodies. That's all of them.</i>

960
01:47:56,512 --> 01:47:57,722
<i>The equipment's totaled.</i>

961
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:03,019
Jesus Christ.

962
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:09,567
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

963
01:48:10,443 --> 01:48:12,946
I'll drive them out with gas first.

964
01:48:14,197 --> 01:48:15,782
It'll be humane.

965
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:18,868
More or less.

966
01:48:20,578 --> 01:48:22,413
All right, let's pull the trigger.

967
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:28,252
Come on, people.
Let's get it packed, let's go.

968
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:31,756
You know, they never even
wanted us to succeed.

969
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:38,137
They bulldozed a sacred site
on purpose to trigger a response.

970
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:40,932
Just fabricating this war
to get what they want.

971
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:43,393
This is how it's done.

972
01:48:46,187 --> 01:48:49,482
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

973
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:53,611
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

974
01:48:53,695 --> 01:48:56,990
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

975
01:48:57,073 --> 01:48:58,074
My God.

976
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:08,793
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

977
01:49:08,793 --> 01:49:12,588
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to...

978
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:13,756
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

979
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:17,260
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

980
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:18,970
All right? Look around!

981
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:22,765
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

982
01:49:22,849 --> 01:49:24,308
- Can you guys just please...
- Yes, sir.

983
01:49:24,392 --> 01:49:26,978
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

984
01:49:26,978 --> 01:49:28,271
Are you gonna kill children?

985
01:49:28,354 --> 01:49:32,275
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

986
01:49:32,358 --> 01:49:34,777
Just let me try to talk them out.

987
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:37,071
They trust me.

988
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:42,827
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

989
01:49:42,827 --> 01:49:44,829
Calibrating three and four.

990
01:49:44,829 --> 01:49:47,790
- Run sequence.
-lnitiating. Thirty seconds.

991
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:53,963
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

992
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:56,632
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

993
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:59,302
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

994
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:28,164
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

995
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:33,544
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

996
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,505
Are you certain of this?

997
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:43,012
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

998
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:47,475
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

999
01:50:50,019 --> 01:50:53,648
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

1000
01:50:56,859 --> 01:50:58,402
Yes.

1001
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:00,863
Look, at first it was just orders,

1002
01:51:02,365 --> 01:51:04,742
and then everything changed.

1003
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:06,536
Okay? I fell in love.

1004
01:51:07,203 --> 01:51:12,500
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

1005
01:51:13,668 --> 01:51:15,128
And with you.

1006
01:51:16,087 --> 01:51:17,922
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

1007
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:20,883
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.

1008
01:51:28,224 --> 01:51:30,726
You will never be one of The People!

1009
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:32,603
- I shouldn't have...
- We tried to stop them!

1010
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:34,647
Neytiri, please! Please.

1011
01:51:43,656 --> 01:51:46,993
You have to go. They're coming!

1012
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,092
<i>Time on target, one mike.</i>

1013
01:52:03,092 --> 01:52:05,136
<i>Copy. We have a visual.</i>

1014
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:08,181
<i>Roger that. Stay on heading 030.</i>

1015
01:52:08,264 --> 01:52:09,599
<i>Roger, 030.</i>

1016
01:52:23,404 --> 01:52:25,448
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

1017
01:52:27,074 --> 01:52:30,912
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!

1018
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:36,959
Run to the forest! Run!

1019
01:52:39,337 --> 01:52:40,671
Run! Run!

1020
01:53:01,192 --> 01:53:04,946
No! God damn it, run!

1021
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:14,747
That is one big damn tree.

1022
01:53:22,255 --> 01:53:26,467
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1023
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,513
All right, people, let's get this done!

1024
01:53:30,596 --> 01:53:33,516
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

1025
01:53:33,516 --> 01:53:35,559
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

1026
01:53:35,935 --> 01:53:37,144
- Fire.
- Firing.

1027
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,616
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1028
01:53:58,541 --> 01:54:00,209
Sir, they've opened fire.

1029
01:54:02,086 --> 01:54:03,838
You've got to be kidding me!

1030
01:54:16,392 --> 01:54:18,894
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

1031
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:20,730
All right, let's turn up the heat.

1032
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:23,733
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

1033
01:54:23,733 --> 01:54:24,859
<i>Fire.</i>

1034
01:54:28,154 --> 01:54:29,238
No!

1035
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,800
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1036
01:54:53,554 --> 01:54:54,764
Neytiri!

1037
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:06,484
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

1038
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:07,860
My God!

1039
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:29,799
- Mo'at! No!
- If you are one of us,

1040
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,635
help us.

1041
01:55:40,393 --> 01:55:42,395
All call signs, switch missiles.

1042
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,980
<i>Give me HE 's
at the base of the west columns.</i>

1043
01:55:46,941 --> 01:55:48,192

1044
01:55:49,318 --> 01:55:51,195
<i>Rider section, switch missiles.</i>

<i>Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.</i>

1049
01:56:07,211 --> 01:56:08,796
Come on, Grace, move!

1050
01:56:11,424 --> 01:56:13,008
Down! Head down!

1051
01:56:15,594 --> 01:56:17,847
Come on, come on! Down!

1052

<i>- Solid hits.

1053
01:56:24,687 --> 01:56:25,855
Screw this.

1054
01:56:27,106 --> 01:56:29,108
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1055
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:30,985
I didn't sign up for this shit!

No, no, get back! Back!

Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1060

That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

1067

Get away!

1068
02:00:28,347 --> 02:00:30,099
Get away from here!

1069

Never come back!

1070
02:00:50,828 --> 02:00:51,954
Pull the plug.

- You can't do that!

Put him down!

1077
02:01:38,751 --> 02:01:41,503
You murderer!

1078
02:02:28,133 --> 02:02:30,219
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1079
02:02:30,302 --> 02:02:31,386
Hey.

1080
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:35,432
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1081
02:02:35,516 --> 02:02:38,894
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

1082
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:42,439
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1083

- All the way down.

- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

1088
02:03:34,032 --> 02:03:37,995
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1089
02:03:37,995 --> 02:03:39,288
Okay. Go.

1090

It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

Come on, we're in. Let's go!

02:04:33,342 --> 02:04:35,177
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1101
02:04:47,814 --> 02:04:49,149
Colonel!

1102
02:04:55,864 --> 02:04:59,409
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

1103
02:05:02,621 --> 02:05:05,290
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

1104
02:05:05,374 --> 02:05:06,917
Oh, yeah, baby!

1105
02:05:06,917 --> 02:05:08,835
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

1106
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:12,047
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1107
02:05:12,297 --> 02:05:14,091
- Grace is hit!
- What?

1108
02:05:15,217 --> 02:05:16,885
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

1109
02:05:16,885 --> 02:05:20,389
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1110
02:05:20,472 --> 02:05:24,977
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1111
02:05:28,313 --> 02:05:30,774
<i>- You're good to go.</i>
- Take <i>it up!</i>

1112
02:05:31,942 --> 02:05:33,777
<i>Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.</i>

1113
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:39,658
You're clear!

1114
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:50,335
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1115
02:05:50,419 --> 02:05:51,837
<i>Copy that.</i>

1116
02:05:58,802 --> 02:06:02,097
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep! <i>Still</i> here.

1117
02:06:03,974 --> 02:06:08,645
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1118
02:06:08,729 --> 02:06:10,772
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1119
02:06:10,856 --> 02:06:12,357
<i>Yeah.</i>

1120
02:06:12,441 --> 02:06:14,401
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1121
02:06:23,243 --> 02:06:24,411
Ouch.

1122
02:06:27,789 --> 02:06:29,249
You big baby.

1123
02:06:30,584 --> 02:06:32,044
We're moving.

1124
02:06:32,586 --> 02:06:34,629
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1125
02:06:35,589 --> 02:06:37,758
I'm a scientist, remember?

1126
02:06:38,675 --> 02:06:41,136
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1127
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:43,889
The People can help you.

1128
02:06:44,347 --> 02:06:45,640
I know it.

1129
02:06:47,642 --> 02:06:49,519
Why would they help us?

1130
02:07:05,535 --> 02:07:08,663
<i>The People say Eywa will provide.</i>

1131
02:07:10,582 --> 02:07:13,293
<i>With no home, no hope,</i>

1132
02:07:14,336 --> 02:07:16,505
<i>there was only one place they could go.</i>

1133
02:07:30,936 --> 02:07:32,145
Link's running.

1134
02:07:32,854 --> 02:07:35,857
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

1135
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:41,571
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1136
02:07:42,531 --> 02:07:43,949
<i>L</i> gotta try-

1137
02:07:46,701 --> 02:07:48,036
Launching.

1138
02:08:09,516 --> 02:08:10,725
<i>Outcast.</i>

1139
02:08:11,518 --> 02:08:12,769
<i>Betrayer.</i>

1140
02:08:13,854 --> 02:08:15,021
<i>Alien.</i>

1141
02:08:16,565 --> 02:08:19,276
<i>I was in the place the eye does not see.</i>

1142
02:08:30,453 --> 02:08:34,332
<i>I needed their help, and they needed mine.</i>

1143
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:37,294
<i>But to ever face them again,</i>

1144
02:08:37,294 --> 02:08:39,796
<i>I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.</i>

1145
02:08:48,346 --> 02:08:51,683
<i>Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move.</i>

1146
02:08:54,436 --> 02:08:56,813
There's something we gotta do.

1147
02:08:56,897 --> 02:08:58,607
You're not gonna like it.

1148
02:09:08,617 --> 02:09:12,495
<i>The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.</i>

1149
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:14,164
<i>Nothing attacks him.</i>

1150
02:09:14,664 --> 02:09:15,999
Easy, boy.

1151
02:09:16,458 --> 02:09:18,293
<i>So why would he ever look up?</i>

1152
02:09:19,419 --> 02:09:21,046
<i>But that was just a theory.</i>

1153
02:10:31,741 --> 02:10:33,368
<i>Toruk Macto?</i>

1154
02:11:13,158 --> 02:11:14,659
I See you.

1155
02:11:17,746 --> 02:11:19,080
I See you.

1156
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:29,090
I was afraid, Jake.

1157
02:11:30,508 --> 02:11:32,010
For my people.

1158
02:11:35,055 --> 02:11:36,681
I'm not anymore.

1159
02:11:57,869 --> 02:12:02,123
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior.

1160
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:05,460
I can't do this without you.

1161
02:12:12,509 --> 02:12:13,927
<i>Toruk Macto,</i>

1162
02:12:21,768 --> 02:12:23,520
I will fly with you.

1163
02:12:26,815 --> 02:12:28,566
My friend is dying.

1164
02:12:30,944 --> 02:12:32,487
Grace is dying.

1165
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:36,324
I beg the help of Eywa.

1166
02:12:48,253 --> 02:12:50,255
Look where we are, Grace.

1167
02:12:56,970 --> 02:12:59,347
I need to take some samples.

1168
02:13:22,787 --> 02:13:26,875
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1169
02:13:28,084 --> 02:13:29,544
in this body.

1170
02:13:32,088 --> 02:13:33,756
Is that possible?

1171
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:38,344
She must pass through the eye of Eywa
and return.

1172
02:13:39,596 --> 02:13:41,139
But, Jakesully,

1173
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:43,766
she is very weak.

1174
02:13:45,226 --> 02:13:48,062
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1175
02:14:44,285 --> 02:14:45,370
Jake.

1176
02:14:47,789 --> 02:14:48,957
Grace.

1177
02:14:51,084 --> 02:14:52,794
I'm with her, Jake.

1178
02:14:54,796 --> 02:14:56,172
She's real!

1179
02:14:59,217 --> 02:15:02,387
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1180
02:15:03,555 --> 02:15:05,181
What's happening?

1181
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:07,809
What's happening?

1182
02:15:12,146 --> 02:15:13,314
Grace!

1183
02:15:14,023 --> 02:15:15,191
Grace!

1184
02:15:17,277 --> 02:15:18,903
What's happening?

1185
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:26,578
Did it work?

1186
02:15:32,250 --> 02:15:36,337
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1187
02:15:38,006 --> 02:15:39,757
She is with Eywa now.

1188
02:16:13,541 --> 02:16:16,210
With your permission, I will speak now.

1189
02:16:18,588 --> 02:16:21,049
You would honor me by translating.

1190
02:16:28,139 --> 02:16:30,350
The Sky People have sent us a message

1191
02:16:33,728 --> 02:16:36,147
that they can take whatever they want

1192
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:39,734
and no one can stop them.

1193
02:16:43,321 --> 02:16:45,114
Well, we will send them a message.

1194
02:16:47,742 --> 02:16:50,078
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1195
02:16:53,373 --> 02:16:55,750
You tell the other clans to come.

1196
02:16:58,878 --> 02:17:01,381
You tell them <i>Toruk Macto</i> calls to them.

1197
02:17:03,591 --> 02:17:06,386
And you fly now with me!

1198
02:17:07,428 --> 02:17:09,931
My brothers! Sisters!

1199
02:17:11,015 --> 02:17:13,101
And we will show the Sky People

1200
02:17:14,102 --> 02:17:15,978
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1201
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:18,940
and that this,

1202
02:17:19,649 --> 02:17:20,692
this is our land!

1203
02:17:27,782 --> 02:17:29,242
<i>Yam!</i>

1204
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:45,758
<i>Yam!</i>

1205
02:18:15,163 --> 02:18:16,539
<i>Yam!</i>

1206
02:18:34,056 --> 02:18:35,558
<i>We rode out to the four winds.</i>

1207
02:18:38,311 --> 02:18:40,730
<i>To the horse clans of the plain.</i>

1208
02:18:43,691 --> 02:18:44,734
Back to the stars!

1209
02:18:44,817 --> 02:18:47,069
<i>To the 'man people of the Eastern Sea.</i>

1210
02:18:47,069 --> 02:18:48,362
For our children's children!

1211
02:18:48,446 --> 02:18:51,032
<i>When Toruk Macks called them, they came.</i>

1212
02:18:54,869 --> 02:18:56,245
<i>Yam!</i>

1213
02:19:32,406 --> 02:19:34,909
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1214
02:19:34,992 --> 02:19:36,828
is fighting for survival.

1215
02:19:36,911 --> 02:19:38,412
That's a fact!

1216
02:19:39,247 --> 02:19:43,000
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1217
02:19:44,085 --> 02:19:47,964
Now, these orbital images tell me

1218
02:19:48,381 --> 02:19:51,634
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1219
02:19:51,634 --> 02:19:54,220
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1220
02:19:54,762 --> 02:19:56,764
And more are pouring in.

1221
02:19:59,225 --> 02:20:02,645
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1222
02:20:02,728 --> 02:20:05,106
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1223
02:20:05,106 --> 02:20:07,358
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1224
02:20:08,943 --> 02:20:12,613
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1225
02:20:12,613 --> 02:20:15,032
We will fight terror with terror.

1226
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:23,499
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1227
02:20:23,583 --> 02:20:26,002
is protected by their...

1228
02:20:26,002 --> 02:20:27,420
Their deity.

1229
02:20:28,713 --> 02:20:30,840
And when we destroy it,

1230
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:33,217
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1231
02:20:33,301 --> 02:20:36,804
that they won't come
within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1232
02:20:36,888 --> 02:20:39,599
And that, too, is a fact.

1233
02:20:40,308 --> 02:20:42,059
Yeah! Yeah.

1234
02:20:52,528 --> 02:20:56,490
<i>Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.</i>

1235
02:20:56,574 --> 02:20:58,826
<i>They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.</i>

1236
02:20:58,910 --> 02:21:01,829
<i>It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.</i>

1237
02:21:01,913 --> 02:21:03,831
Fricking daisy cutters!

1238
02:21:05,333 --> 02:21:08,169
<i>Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.</i>

1239
02:21:08,252 --> 02:21:10,338
<i>- When?
-0600 tomorrow.</i>

1240
02:21:10,421 --> 02:21:12,298
<i>- Max! Max!
-l gotta go.</i>

1241
02:21:14,175 --> 02:21:15,676
We're screwed!

1242
02:21:17,136 --> 02:21:19,388
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1243
02:21:19,388 --> 02:21:21,641
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1244
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:26,479
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1245
02:21:29,482 --> 02:21:31,525
I have 15 clans out there.

1246
02:21:32,193 --> 02:21:34,320
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1247
02:21:35,821 --> 02:21:40,284
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1248
02:21:41,327 --> 02:21:45,373
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

1249
02:21:45,873 --> 02:21:47,375
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1250
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:51,712
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

1251
02:21:53,589 --> 02:21:57,051
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1252
02:21:57,134 --> 02:21:58,386
Yeah, I know.

1253
02:21:58,386 --> 02:22:00,930
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1254
02:22:01,013 --> 02:22:04,225
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1255
02:22:05,017 --> 02:22:07,061
It'll destroy them.

1256
02:22:07,061 --> 02:22:09,522
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1257
02:22:24,578 --> 02:22:27,581
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1258
02:22:30,001 --> 02:22:34,755
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1259
02:22:37,299 --> 02:22:41,721
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1260
02:22:42,972 --> 02:22:45,099
See the world we come from.

1261
02:22:46,183 --> 02:22:48,102
There's no green there.

1262
02:22:49,478 --> 02:22:51,480
They killed their Mother.

1263
02:22:52,273 --> 02:22:54,775
And they're gonna do the same here.

1264
02:22:56,402 --> 02:22:58,988
More Sky People are gonna come.

1265
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:02,116
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1266
02:23:03,409 --> 02:23:05,161
Unless we stop them.

1267
02:23:07,747 --> 02:23:10,833
Look, you chose me for something.

1268
02:23:12,293 --> 02:23:14,170
I will stand and fight.

1269
02:23:15,212 --> 02:23:16,797
You know I will.

1270
02:23:19,300 --> 02:23:21,552
But I need a little help here.

1271
02:23:27,683 --> 02:23:30,728
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1272
02:23:32,521 --> 02:23:35,983
She protects only the balance of life.

1273
02:23:47,787 --> 02:23:49,497
It was worth a try.

1274
02:24:20,194 --> 02:24:22,238
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1275
02:24:22,238 --> 02:24:25,616
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1276
02:24:37,711 --> 02:24:41,090
<i>This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.</i>

1277
02:24:41,465 --> 02:24:45,052
<i>- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode.</i>

1278
02:25:19,962 --> 02:25:21,839
This is Papa Dragon.

1279
02:25:21,922 --> 02:25:25,009
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1280
02:25:32,516 --> 02:25:36,270
- Suit <i>Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!</i>

1281
02:25:46,822 --> 02:25:48,449
Move, move, move!

1282
02:25:54,079 --> 02:25:55,873
<i>Bravo 1-1, move left.</i>

1283
02:25:56,415 --> 02:25:59,835
<i>Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.</i>

1284
02:26:02,171 --> 02:26:05,799
<i>- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that.</i>

1285
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:08,219
<i>Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.</i>

1286
02:26:08,302 --> 02:26:09,678
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

1287
02:26:09,678 --> 02:26:14,391
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1288
02:26:14,975 --> 02:26:18,354
<i>All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.</i>

1289
02:26:18,354 --> 02:26:20,814
<i>Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.</i>

1290
02:26:25,903 --> 02:26:28,447
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1291
02:26:29,406 --> 02:26:32,034
<i>Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.</i>

1292
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:35,079
<i>Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.</i>

1293
02:26:36,664 --> 02:26:39,917
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

1294
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,211
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1295
02:26:42,336 --> 02:26:44,838
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1296
02:26:45,631 --> 02:26:47,841
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1297
02:26:50,094 --> 02:26:51,178
Hold!

1298
02:26:59,186 --> 02:27:01,230
<i>Charlie 2-1, got big movement.</i>

1299
02:27:01,313 --> 02:27:02,731
<i>- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up.</i>

1300
02:27:02,815 --> 02:27:06,986
<i>- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2- 1, hold position.</i>

1301
02:27:13,075 --> 02:27:16,078
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1302
02:27:16,078 --> 02:27:18,664
<i>- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!</i>

1303
02:27:19,039 --> 02:27:21,750
<i>Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.</i>

1304
02:27:22,459 --> 02:27:25,212
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir. It's the Flux.

1305
02:27:53,490 --> 02:27:56,160
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1306
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:40,662
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1307
02:28:41,789 --> 02:28:42,998
Break right. Come around.

1308
02:28:46,543 --> 02:28:48,045
Light them up!

1309
02:28:55,677 --> 02:28:57,888
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1310
02:29:05,145 --> 02:29:07,022
Yeah! Get some!

1311
02:29:46,019 --> 02:29:47,855
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1312
02:29:58,699 --> 02:30:00,492
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1313
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:03,871
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1314
02:30:03,871 --> 02:30:04,872
Copy. Get out of there.

1315
02:30:10,043 --> 02:30:11,462
That's him. Get after him!

1316
02:30:28,395 --> 02:30:29,897
Take him out!

1317
02:30:38,197 --> 02:30:39,656
Light her up!

1318
02:30:48,665 --> 02:30:50,083
Right there!

1319
02:30:50,209 --> 02:30:52,461
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1320
02:30:52,711 --> 02:30:54,421
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

1321
02:30:54,421 --> 02:30:55,506
Arming all pods.

1322
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:02,304
That's it!

1323
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,086
Seyzey!

1324
02:32:38,025 --> 02:32:40,193
<i>Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.</i>

1325
02:32:41,153 --> 02:32:42,571
Sorry, Jake.

1326
02:32:59,588 --> 02:33:00,672
Fire.

1327
02:33:18,774 --> 02:33:21,276
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1328
02:33:24,112 --> 02:33:25,781
Rogue One, you copy?

1329
02:33:27,783 --> 02:33:28,950
Trudy!

1330
02:33:39,836 --> 02:33:41,129
Time to target, two minutes.

1331
02:33:41,463 --> 02:33:43,882
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1332
02:33:43,965 --> 02:33:46,134
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1333
02:33:51,973 --> 02:33:55,811
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

1334
02:33:57,187 --> 02:33:58,438
Ma Jake!

1335
02:34:00,357 --> 02:34:01,525
I read you.

1336
02:34:10,659 --> 02:34:12,661
<i>- Neytiri!
- Seyzey's</i> dead.

1337
02:34:13,245 --> 02:34:15,747
They are very close. They are many.

1338
02:34:17,165 --> 02:34:18,667
Do not attack.

1339
02:34:19,251 --> 02:34:21,211
<i>Do you read me, Neytiri?</i>

1340
02:34:23,797 --> 02:34:25,090
Do not attack!

1341
02:34:25,424 --> 02:34:28,593
<i>Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!</i>

1342
02:34:36,685 --> 02:34:37,894
<i>Neytiri!</i>

1343
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:41,898
<i>I got movement, I got movement.</i>

1344
02:34:41,982 --> 02:34:44,234
Hold position. Something's coming.

1345
02:34:44,317 --> 02:34:46,111
<i>Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.</i>

1346
02:34:46,194 --> 02:34:48,405
<i>- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation.</i>

1347
02:34:48,405 --> 02:34:50,157
<i>- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks.</i>

1348
02:34:55,287 --> 02:34:56,788
<i>Hundred meters and closing fast.</i>

1349
02:35:13,346 --> 02:35:14,931
We gotta get out of here!

1350
02:35:22,731 --> 02:35:24,441
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! <i>Move! Move!</i>

1351
02:35:24,524 --> 02:35:26,943
<i>Fall back! On the run! On the run!</i>

1352
02:35:34,075 --> 02:35:36,745
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1353
02:35:43,668 --> 02:35:45,462
Eywa has heard you!

1354
02:35:56,014 --> 02:35:57,432
Come on!

1355
02:36:09,694 --> 02:36:11,571
Fall back! Move! Move!

1356
02:36:36,054 --> 02:36:38,765
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1357
02:36:38,765 --> 02:36:42,894
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1358
02:36:42,978 --> 02:36:45,897
<i>- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing</i> to <i>target.</i>

1359
02:36:45,897 --> 02:36:47,941
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1360
02:37:07,752 --> 02:37:10,255
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1361
02:37:10,255 --> 02:37:13,008
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1362
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:47,917
Brace!

1363
02:38:04,934 --> 02:38:06,311
It's Sully.

1364
02:38:19,991 --> 02:38:22,285
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

1365
02:41:06,658 --> 02:41:08,535
Come on. Come to papa.

1366
02:41:35,979 --> 02:41:37,772
Give it up, Quaritch!

1367
02:41:40,817 --> 02:41:42,318
It's all over.

1368
02:41:43,570 --> 02:41:46,114
<i>Nothing's over while I'm breathing.</i>

1369
02:41:46,114 --> 02:41:48,408
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1370
02:42:44,547 --> 02:42:45,798
Come on!

1371
02:43:01,648 --> 02:43:05,777
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1372
02:43:10,406 --> 02:43:12,617
You think you're one of them?

1373
02:43:13,826 --> 02:43:15,495
Time to wake up.

1374
02:44:59,682 --> 02:45:00,767
Jake?

1375
02:45:14,447 --> 02:45:15,573
Jake.

1376
02:45:33,549 --> 02:45:34,967
Jake.

1377
02:45:50,983 --> 02:45:52,985
Jake! Ma Jake!

1378
02:46:34,652 --> 02:46:35,987
I See you.

1379
02:46:41,576 --> 02:46:42,910
I See you.

1380
02:47:08,019 --> 02:47:09,228
I See you, Brother.

1381
02:47:10,438 --> 02:47:11,647
Are The People safe?

1382
02:47:14,483 --> 02:47:15,610
They're safe.

1383
02:47:22,116 --> 02:47:23,618
I can't...

1384
02:47:24,785 --> 02:47:27,038
I cannot lead The People.

1385
02:47:27,580 --> 02:47:29,916
You must lead them...Jakesully.

1386
02:47:31,292 --> 02:47:33,210
I'm not officer material.

1387
02:47:33,294 --> 02:47:35,046
It is decided.

1388
02:47:38,382 --> 02:47:39,592
Now...

1389
02:47:40,801 --> 02:47:43,220
...do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

1390
02:47:47,808 --> 02:47:49,477
I will not kill you.

1391
02:47:49,518 --> 02:47:51,145
It is the way!

1392
02:47:53,481 --> 02:47:55,066
And it is good.

1393
02:47:57,318 --> 02:47:59,153
I will be remembered.

1394
02:48:01,781 --> 02:48:05,826
I fought...with Toruk Macto!

1395
02:48:08,329 --> 02:48:10,206
And we were brothers.

1396
02:48:11,624 --> 02:48:15,711
And he...was my last shadow.

1397
02:49:02,133 --> 02:49:04,969
<i>The aliens went back to their dying world.</i>

1398
02:49:07,138 --> 02:49:10,057
<i>Only a few were chosen to stay.</i>

1399
02:49:22,278 --> 02:49:24,822
<i>The time of great sorrow was ending.</i>

1400
02:49:26,866 --> 02:49:29,285
<i>Toruk Macks was no longer needed.</i>

1401
02:49:41,839 --> 02:49:45,718
<i>Well, I guess this is my last video log.</i>

1402
02:49:47,553 --> 02:49:51,390
<i>'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm...</i>

1403
02:49:52,391 --> 02:49:55,227
<i>I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place.</i>

1404
02:49:58,856 --> 02:50:00,983
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1405
02:50:03,569 --> 02:50:06,614
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party.

1406
02:50:09,950 --> 02:50:12,411
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1407
02:50:14,914 --> 02:50:17,249
<i>This is Jake Sully signing off.</i>
