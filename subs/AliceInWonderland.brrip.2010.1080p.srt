1
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, you have finally
lost your senses.</font>

2
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This venture is impossible.</font>

3
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For some. Gentlemen, the only
way to achieve the impossible</font>

4
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to believe it is possible.</font>

5
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That kind of thinking
could ruin you.</font>

6
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm willing to take that chance.</font>

7
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:33,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine trading posts in
Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...</font>

8
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nightmare again?</font>

9
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't be long.</font>

10
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm falling down a dark hole,</font>

11
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I see strange creatures.</font>

12
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of creatures?</font>

13
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:05,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's a dodo bird, a rabbit
in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.</font>

14
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know cats could smile.</font>

15
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither did I.</font>

16
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's a blue caterpillar.</font>

17
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue caterpillar.</font>

18
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

19
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think I've
gone round the bend?</font>

20
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:31,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid so. You're mad,
bonkers, off your head.</font>

21
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.</font>

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.</font>

23
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you get too frightened, you
can always wake up. Like this.</font>

24
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

25
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must we go?</font>

26
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doubt they'll notice
if we never arrive.</font>

27
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will notice.</font>

28
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your corset?</font>

29
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And no stockings.</font>

30
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm against them.</font>

31
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're not properly dressed.</font>

32
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's to say what is proper?</font>

33
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?</font>

34
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you wear it?
- Alice.</font>

35
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To me, a corset is
like a codfish.</font>

36
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, not today.</font>

37
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father would have laughed.</font>

38
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I'm tired. I
didn't sleep well last night.</font>

39
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you have bad dreams again?</font>

40
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one.</font>

41
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's always the same, ever
since I can remember.</font>

42
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think that's normal?</font>

43
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't most people have
different dreams?</font>

44
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

45
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. You're beautiful.</font>

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, can you manage a smile?</font>

47
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At last. We thought
you'd never arrive.</font>

48
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:44,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.</font>

49
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do realize it's
well past 4:00.</font>

50
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now everything will have
to be rushed through.</font>

51
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!</font>

52
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.</font>

53
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only Charles were here...</font>

54
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My condolences.</font>

55
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.</font>

56
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.</font>

57
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not. I'm pleased that
you purchased the company.</font>

58
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a fool for not investing in his
mad venture when I had the chance.</font>

59
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles thought so, too.</font>

60
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish, do you ever
tire of quadrille?</font>

61
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary. I
find it invigorating.</font>

62
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I amuse you?</font>

63
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

64
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a sudden vision of
all the ladies in trousers</font>

65
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the men wearing dresses.</font>

66
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you'll do best to keep
your visions to yourself.</font>

67
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When in doubt, remain silent.</font>

68
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon us, sir. Miss Kingsleigh
is distracted today.</font>

69
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your head?</font>

70
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was wondering what it
would be like to fly.</font>

71
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you spend your time</font>

72
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinking about such
an impossible thing?</font>

73
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why wouldn't I?</font>

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father said he sometimes
believed in 6 impossible things</font>

75
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before breakfast.</font>

76
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come along.</font>

77
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, meet me under the gazebo
in precisely 10 minutes.</font>

78
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a secret to tell you.</font>

79
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're telling me, then
it's not much of a secret.</font>

80
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.</font>

81
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we tell her, she
won't be surprised.</font>

82
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.</font>

83
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now you've brought
it up, you have to.</font>

84
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.</font>

85
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if your mother knows</font>

86
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.</font>

87
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.</font>

88
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's your mother right now.</font>

89
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish is going to
ask for your hand.</font>

90
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've ruined the surprise!</font>

91
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could strangle them!</font>

92
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone went to so much
effort to keep the secret.</font>

93
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does everyone know?</font>

94
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.</font>

95
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish will ask you under the
gazebo. When you say yes...</font>

96
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't know if I
want to marry Hamish.</font>

97
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who, then? You won't
do better than a lord.</font>

98
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll soon be 20, Alice. That
pretty face won't last forever.</font>

99
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to end
up like Aunt Imogene.</font>

100
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you don't want to be a
burden on Mother, do you?</font>

101
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

102
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you'll marry Hamish.</font>

103
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will be as happy
as I am with Lowell,</font>

104
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your life will be perfect.</font>

105
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's already decided.</font>

106
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, dear.</font>

107
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll leave you to it.</font>

108
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden, just you and me?</font>

109
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what
I've always dreaded?</font>

110
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The decline of the aristocracy?</font>

111
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugly grandchildren.
But you're lovely.</font>

112
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're bound to produce
little... Imbeciles!</font>

113
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gardeners have
planted white roses</font>

114
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I specifically
asked for red.</font>

115
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could always
paint the roses red.</font>

116
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What an odd thing to say.</font>

117
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should know that my son has
extremely delicate digestion.</font>

118
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you see that?
- See what?</font>

119
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was a rabbit, I think.
- Nasty things.</font>

120
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do enjoy setting
the dogs on them.</font>

121
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you serve Hamish the wrong
foods, he could get a blockage.</font>

122
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see it that time?</font>

123
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See what?
- The rabbit.</font>

124
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't shout.</font>

125
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, pay attention. Hamish said
you were easily distracted.</font>

126
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.</font>

127
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't be more interested,
but you'll have to excuse me.</font>

128
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aunt Imogene.</font>

129
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm going mad. I keep
seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.</font>

130
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't be bothered with
your fancy rabbit now.</font>

131
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm waiting for my fiance.</font>

132
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You have a fiance?
- Hmm.</font>

133
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There! Did you see it?</font>

134
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a prince.</font>

135
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:50,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, alas, he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne.</font>

136
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tragic, isn't it?</font>

137
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very.</font>

138
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lowell?</font>

139
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice. We were just...</font>

140
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hattie's an old friend.</font>

141
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see you're very close.</font>

142
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you won't mention this
to your sister, will you?</font>

143
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:21,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I'm confused.
I need time to think.</font>

144
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.</font>

145
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to ruin
her marriage, do you?</font>

146
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me?</font>

147
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm not the one who's
sneaking around behind her back.</font>

148
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>

149
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice Kingsleigh...</font>

150
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish.</font>

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

152
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a caterpillar
on your shoulder.</font>

153
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew.</font>

154
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't hurt it.</font>

155
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll want to wash that finger.</font>

156
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice Kingsleigh,</font>

157
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will you be my wife?</font>

158
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,</font>

159
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everyone expects me to,</font>

160
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're a lord.</font>

161
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My face won't last, and I
don't want to end up like...</font>

162
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is happening
so quickly. I...</font>

163
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I...</font>

164
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I...</font>

165
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a moment.</font>

166
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

167
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a dream.</font>

168
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think she would remember
all this from the first time.</font>

169
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've brought
the wrong Alice.</font>

170
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she's the right one.
I'm certain of it.</font>

171
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the wrong Alice.</font>

172
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give her a chance.</font>

173
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Curiouser and curiouser.</font>

174
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you she's
the right Alice.</font>

175
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not convinced.</font>

176
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that for gratitude?</font>

177
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been up there for weeks,
trailing one Alice after the next,</font>

178
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I was almost eaten
by other animals.</font>

179
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you imagine?</font>

180
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They go about entirely unclothed,
and they do their shukm in public.</font>

181
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I had to avert my eyes.
- Doesn't look anything like herself.</font>

182
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because she's
the wrong Alice.</font>

183
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- If she was, she might be.
- If she isn't, she ain't.</font>

184
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But if she were so, she would be.
- But she isn't, nohow.</font>

185
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I be the wrong Alice
when this is my dream?</font>

186
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who are you, if I might ask?</font>

187
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm Tweedledee,
he's Tweedledum.</font>

188
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.</font>

189
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should consult Absolem.</font>

190
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly. Absolem will
know who she is.</font>

191
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll escort you.
- Hey, it's not being your turn.</font>

192
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So unfair.</font>

193
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, leave off!
- Let go!</font>

194
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are they always this way?
- Family trait.</font>

195
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can both escort her.</font>

196
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:59,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who is this Absolem?
- He's wise. He's absolute.</font>

197
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's Absolem.</font>

198
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

199
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolem?</font>

200
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:35,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.
The question is, who are you?</font>

201
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice.</font>

202
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shall see.</font>

203
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am.</font>

204
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:48,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you ought, stupid girl.
Unroll the Oraculum.</font>

205
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Oraculum, being a calendrical
compendium of Underland.</font>

206
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a calendar.
- Compendium.</font>

207
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:11,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tells of each and every
day since the Beginning.</font>

208
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today is Griblig Day in the
time of the Red Queen.</font>

209
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show her the Frabjous Day.</font>

210
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the
day you slay the Jabberwocky.</font>

211
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry? Slay a what?</font>

212
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. That being you,
there, with the Vorpal sword.</font>

213
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No other swords can kill
the Jabberwocky, nohow.</font>

214
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it ain't Vorpal,
it ain't dead.</font>

215
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not me!</font>

216
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know!</font>

217
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?</font>

218
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not hardly.</font>

219
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I told you.
- Oh, dear.</font>

220
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I said so.
- I said so.</font>

221
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, you
said she might be.</font>

222
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you said she
would be if she was.</font>

223
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little impostor. Pretending to
be Alice. She should be ashamed.</font>

224
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was so certain of you.</font>

225
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be the wrong Alice.</font>

226
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, this is my dream.</font>

227
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to wake up now
and you'll all disappear.</font>

228
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's odd. Pinching
usually does the trick.</font>

229
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could stick you,
if that would help.</font>

230
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It might, actually.
- Thank you. My pleasure.</font>

231
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

232
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bandersnatch!
- Bandersnatch!</font>

233
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

234
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a dream.
Nothing can hurt me.</font>

235
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she doing?</font>

236
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't hurt me. Can't hurt me.</font>

237
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, you great lug!</font>

238
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way, east to Queast.</font>

239
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, South to Snud.</font>

240
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no. This way.</font>

241
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone has stolen
three of my tarts!</font>

242
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.</font>

243
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you?
- No, Your Majesty.</font>

244
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.</font>

245
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you steal my tarts?</font>

246
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Your Majesty.</font>

247
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Squimberry juice.</font>

248
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was so hungry! I didn't mean to!
- Off with his head!</font>

249
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My family! Oh, please,
please don't!</font>

250
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I have little
ones to look after!</font>

251
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to his house and
collect the little ones.</font>

252
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love tadpoles on toast almost
as much as I love caviar.</font>

253
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

254
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink!</font>

255
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty?</font>

256
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:28,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ilosovic Stayne, you knave,
where have you been lurking?</font>

257
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:34,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, I have
found the Oraculum.</font>

258
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That? Looks so ordinary
for an oracle.</font>

259
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look here, on the Frabjous Day.</font>

260
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd know that tangled
mess of hair anywhere.</font>

261
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it Alice?</font>

262
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe it is.</font>

263
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she doing with
my darling Jabberwocky?</font>

264
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She appears to be slaying it.</font>

265
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?</font>

266

00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all about you, you know.</font>

398
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:41,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not slaying anything. I don't
slay, so put it out of your mind.</font>

399
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind.</font>

400
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! You can't leave me here!</font>

401
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't slay.</font>

402
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any idea what
the Red Queen has done?</font>

403
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't slay.</font>

404
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't if I wanted to.</font>

405
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the same
as you were before.</font>

406
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:20,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were much more muchier.
You've lost your muchness.</font>

407
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My "muchness"?</font>

408
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In there. Something's missing.</font>

409
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me what Red Queen has done.</font>

410
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a pretty story.</font>

411
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me anyway.</font>

412
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was here.</font>

413
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was hatter to the White
Queen at the time.</font>

414
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hightopp clan have always
been employed at court.</font>

415
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter? Hatter!</font>

416
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>

417
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you?</font>

418
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear that? I'm
certain I heard something.</font>

419
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

420
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Red Knights.</font>

421
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go South to Trotter's Bottom.</font>

422
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The White Queen's
castle is just beyond.</font>

423
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on tightly.</font>

424
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down with the bloody Red Queen!</font>

425
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to lead them
away! The Hatter trusted you!</font>

426
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have my wife and pups.</font>

427
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's your name?
- Bayard.</font>

428
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit!</font>

429
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would your name be
Alice, by any chance?</font>

430
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but I'm not the one that
everyone's talking about.</font>

431
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hatter would not have given
himself up just for any Alice.</font>

432
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did they take him?</font>

433
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the Red Queen's
castle at Salazen Grum.</font>

434
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to rescue him.</font>

435
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is not foretold.</font>

436
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care. He wouldn't be
there if it weren't for me.</font>

437
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Frabjous Day
is almost upon us.</font>

438
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must prepare to
meet the Jabberwocky.</font>

439
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the moment I fell
down that rabbit hole,</font>

440
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been told what I must
do and who I must be.</font>

441
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:42,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been shrunk, stretched,
scratched and stuffed into a teapot.</font>

442
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been accused of being Alice and of
not being Alice, but this is my dream.</font>

443
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll decide where
it goes from here.</font>

444
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you diverge from the path...</font>

445
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I make the path.</font>

446
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard,
and don't forget the hat.</font>

447
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one way across.</font>

448
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lost my muchness, have I?</font>

449
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bayard! The hat!</font>

450
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty.</font>

451
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry.</font>

452
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Splendid shot!</font>

453
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my ball? Page!</font>

454
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

455
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to help you.</font>

456
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it isn't
the wrong Alice.</font>

457
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What brings you here? Mmm?</font>

458
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've come to rescue the Hatter.</font>

459
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not rescuing anyone
being the size of a gerbil.</font>

460
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, do you have any more of that
cake that made me grow before?</font>

461
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Upelkuchen? Actually, I
might have some left.</font>

462
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all of it!</font>

463
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't.
Don't do that!</font>

464
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Page!</font>

465
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>

466
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what is this?</font>

467
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It... It's a "who," Majesty.
This is, um...</font>

468
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um?</font>

469
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Umbradge.</font>

470
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to your clothes?</font>

471
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I outgrew them. I've been
growing an awful lot lately.</font>

472
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:04,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tower over everyone in
Umbradge. They laugh at me.</font>

473
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I've come to you, hoping you
might understand what it's like.</font>

474
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dear girl,</font>

475
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:13,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">anyone with a head that large
is welcome in my court.</font>

476
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone find her some clothes!</font>

477
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use the curtains if you must,
but clothe this enormous girl.</font>

478
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a pig here!</font>

479
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love a warm pig belly
for my aching feet.</font>

480
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you like one, Um?
- No, thank you.</font>

481
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit!</font>

482
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit!</font>

483
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go away.</font>

484
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.</font>

485
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fat boys!</font>

486
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. There they are.
Aren't they adorable?</font>

487
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:08,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have the oddest way of
speaking. Speak, boys. Amuse us.</font>

488
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>

489
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

490
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speak!</font>

491
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that being...
- No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.</font>

492
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, I believe it's so.</font>

493
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it ain't so, nohow!</font>

494
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love my fat boys.
Now, get out.</font>

495
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He did pinch me.
- He did pinch me.</font>

496
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:04,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who is this lovely creature?</font>

497
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, my new favorite.</font>

498
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, does she have a name?
- Um.</font>

499
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe your name has
slipped the Queen's mind.</font>

500
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name is Um, idiot!</font>

501
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:19,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Umbradge.</font>

502
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any luck with the prisoner?</font>

503
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's stubborn.</font>

504
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're too soft. Bring him!</font>

505
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know Alice has
returned to Underland.</font>

506
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know where she is?</font>

507
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been considering things
that begin with the letter "M."</font>

508
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:08,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moron, mutiny, murder, malice.</font>

509
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:12,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're looking for an "A"
word now. Where is Alice?</font>

510
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:16,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who, that wee little boy?
I wouldn't know.</font>

511
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?</font>

512
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop that.</font>

513
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a regrettably
large head you have.</font>

514
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should very much
like to hat it.</font>

515
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:30,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hat it?
- Yes.</font>

516
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to hat the White
Queen, you know.</font>

517
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't very much to
work with, poor dear.</font>

518
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her head is so small.</font>

519
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tiny. It's a
pimple of a head.</font>

520
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this...</font>

521
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:48,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I could do with this
monument, this orb...</font>

522
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:53,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nay, this magnificently
heroic globe.</font>

523
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What could you do?</font>

524
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbind him, Stayne.</font>

525
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:06,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can he work if
his hands are bound?</font>

526
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, shall it be
a bonnet or a boater?</font>

527
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or something for the boudoir?</font>

528
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:27,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif,
snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke,</font>

529
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,189

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have our champion. Rest now.
You've done well.</font>

they adore her and not me?</font>

548
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:30,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot fathom it. You are
far superior in all ways.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

I don't need them.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is good to be working
at my trade again.</font>

562
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a pity you have
to make them for her.</font>

563
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the hatter with me?</font>

564
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter.</font>

566

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?</font>

567
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm frightened, Alice.</font>

568
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.</font>

569
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I gone mad?</font>

570
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:36,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid so. You're
entirely bonkers.</font>

571
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:42,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.</font>

572
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

573
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's better. You
look yourself again.</font>

574
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hat man! Where are my hats?</font>

575
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a patient monarch!</font>

576
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm told she keeps the Vorpal
sword hidden in the castle.</font>

577
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rabbit will help you.</font>

578
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find it, Alice. Take
it to the White Queen.</font>

579
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll go to the White
Queen together.</font>

580
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it you're always
too small or too tall?</font>

581
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tweedles.
- Alice.</font>

582

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you do, again?
- Where's the rabbit?</font>

583
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is it you're
being so great big?</font>

584
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She ain't great big, this
is how she normal is.</font>

585
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm certain she's
smaller when we met.</font>

586
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:44,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she drank the pishsalver to
get through the door, recall it?</font>

587
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:45,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

588
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,713

hidden in the castle. Help me find it.</font>

did to my arm.</font>

600
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear, oh, dear. Why haven't
you mentioned this?</font>

601
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't this bad before.</font>

602

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

620
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,800

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind him, he's mad.
Come along.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're late for your
soup, you wee besom.</font>

665
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're late for your soup.
- Could use some salt.</font>

666
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, you!</font>

667
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that here. Choppy,
chop, chop, chop.</font>

668
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leek and potato. Yes.
That would be...</font>

669
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pishsalver. Let me think.</font>

670
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A pinch of worm fat,</font>

671
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">urine of the horsefly,</font>

672
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">buttered fingers.</font>

673
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:47,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sister preferred to study
Dominion Over Living Things.</font>

674
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:52,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, how does
she seem to you?</font>

675
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfectly horrid.</font>

676
01:08:56,049 --> 01:09:00,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And her head?
- Bulbous.</font>

677
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think she may have some
kind of growth in there,</font>

678
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something pressing on her brain.</font>

679
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:12,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three coins from a dead man's pocket,
two teaspoons of wishful thinking.</font>

680
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't imagine the things
that go on in that place.</font>

681
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, I can.</font>

682
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:23,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when a champion steps forth
to slay the Jabberwocky,</font>

683
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the people will
rise against her.</font>

684
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That should do it.</font>

685
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:34,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blow.</font>

686
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Feel better?
- Much, thank you.</font>

687
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's someone here who would
like to speak with you.</font>

688
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Absolem?
- Who are you?</font>

689
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:26,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.</font>

690
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you know?
- You said so yourself.</font>

691
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said you were
not hardly Alice,</font>

692
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:34,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you're much more her now.</font>

693
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, you're almost Alice.</font>

694
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even so,</font>

695
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:42,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky
if my life depended on it.</font>

696
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:43,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will.</font>

697
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I suggest you keep the
Vorpal sword on hand</font>

698
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the Frabjous Day arrives.</font>

699
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem so real.</font>

700
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:56,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I forget that
this is all a dream.</font>

701
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you stop doing that?</font>

702
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've always admired that hat.</font>

703
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Chess.</font>

704
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since you won't be
needing it anymore,</font>

705
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would you consider
bequeathing it to me?</font>

706
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you?</font>

707
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a formal execution. I would
like to look my best, you know.</font>

708
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:40,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a pity about all this.</font>

709
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:44,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was looking forward to
seeing you Futterwacken.</font>

710
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:47,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was rather good
at it, was I not?</font>

711
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really do love that hat.</font>

712
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would wear it to all
the finest occasions.</font>

713
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love a morning
execution, don't you?</font>

714
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

715
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:52,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'd like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself.</font>

716
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:55,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as I can
get at your neck.</font>

717
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right behind you.</font>

718
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:01,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with his head!</font>

719
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't watch.</font>

720
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, everyone.</font>

721
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chess, you dog.</font>

722
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:44,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madam,</font>

723
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are being
heinously bamboozled</font>

724
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:50,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by these lickspittle toadies
you surround yourselves with.</font>

725
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:55,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

726
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:58,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not the only one, Majesty.
Look!</font>

727
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A counterfeit nose. You
should be ashamed.</font>

728
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? What about that big
belly you're so proud of?</font>

729
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:13,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!</font>

730
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with their heads!</font>

731
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:23,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The abused and enslaved
in the Red Queen's court,</font>

732
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of you stand up and fight!</font>

733
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rise up against the
bloody Red Queen.</font>

734
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Release the Jubjub Bird!</font>

736
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right, Stayne,</font>

737
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is far better to
be feared than loved.</font>

738
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, boys. Quickly! Come on!</font>

739
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:24,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter!</font>

740
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mally, quickly.
Come on. Come on.</font>

741
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:34,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.</font>

742
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:47,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had hoped to have
a champion by now.</font>

743
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you slay the
Jabberwocky yourself?</font>

744
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:53,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have the power.</font>

745
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is against my vows to
harm any living creature.</font>

746
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have company.</font>

747
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a look, Bayard.</font>

748
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:23,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bielle.</font>

749
01:16:31,947 --> 01:16:34,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so happy to see you. I
thought they were going to...</font>

750
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:37,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did I. But they didn't, and now
here I am, still in one piece.</font>

751
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm rather glad about that
now that I'm seeing you again.</font>

752
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:42,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have regretted
not seeing you again,</font>

753
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">especially now that you're
you, and the proper size.</font>

754
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's a good size. It's a great
size. It's a right proper Alice size!</font>

755
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:52,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hatter. Size.
- Fez. I'm fine.</font>

756
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your hat?</font>

757
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

758
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cheshire.
- How's the arm, love?</font>

759
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:04,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All healed.</font>

760
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, sweet hat.</font>

761
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:31,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?</font>

762
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me think about it.</font>

763
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:40,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what tomorrow
is, don't you?</font>

764
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Frabjous Day. How
could I forget?</font>

765
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish I'd wake up.</font>

766
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:54,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Still believe this is a dream, do you?
- Of course.</font>

767
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:58,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has all come
from my own mind.</font>

768
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:04,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which would mean
that I'm not real.</font>

769
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:12,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Afraid so. You're just a
figment of my imagination.</font>

770
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would dream up someone
who's half-mad.</font>

771
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:20,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, yes. But you would have
to be half-mad to dream me up.</font>

772
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must be, then.</font>

773
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll miss you when I wake up.</font>

774
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:52,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who will step forth to be
champion for the White Queen?</font>

775
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be I.</font>

776
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:02,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have very poor evaporating
skills. I should be the one.</font>

777
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it.</font>

778
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:08,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, me.
- No, me.</font>

779
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No other slayer, nohow.</font>

780
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it ain't Alice,
it ain't dead.</font>

781
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:40,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, you cannot live your
life to please others.</font>

782
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The choice must be yours,</font>

783
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because when you step out
to face that creature,</font>

784
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will step out alone.</font>

785
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:28,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing was ever
accomplished with tears.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you upside down?</font>

788
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've come to the
end of this life.</font>

789

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're going to die?
- Transform.</font>

790
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't go. I need your help.
I don't know what to do.</font>

791
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:49,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help you if you don't even
know who you are, stupid girl.</font>

01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not stupid.</font>

I live in London.</font>

Charles Kingsleigh.</font>

796
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a vision that stretched
halfway around the world,</font>

797
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nothing ever stopped him.</font>

798
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm his daughter. I'm
Alice Kingsleigh.</font>

799
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:10,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, at last.</font>

800
01:21:10,852 --> 01:21:13,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were just as dim-witted
the first time you were here.</font>

801
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You called it "Wonderland,"
as I recall.</font>

802
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wonderland.</font>

803
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.</font>

804
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:26,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Alice?</font>

805
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll take you to the Hare and the
Hatter, but that's the end of it.</font>

806
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.</font>

807
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:34,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Thackery, not at
the table, please.</font>

808
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:35,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have some tea.</font>

809
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not Absolem, I'm
Absolem, stupid girl.</font>

810
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is this?
- I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.</font>

811
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.</font>

812
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think she would remember
all this from the first time.</font>

813
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Curiouser and curiouser.</font>

814
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:52,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a dream at
all, it was a memory.</font>

815
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:57,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place is real, and so are
you and so is the Hatter.</font>

816
01:21:57,997 --> 01:22:00,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the Jabberwocky.</font>

817
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, the Vorpal sword
knows what it wants.</font>

818
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you have to do
is hold on to it.</font>

819
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:15,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fairfarren, Alice. Perhaps I
will see you in another life.</font>

820
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:20,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, Iracebeth.
- Hello, Mirana.</font>

821
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:28,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On this, the Frabjous Day,
the Queens Red and White</font>

822
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shall send forth their champions
to do battle on their behalf.</font>

823
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:37,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Racie. We don't
have to fight.</font>

824
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're doing.</font>

825
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:45,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you can blink
those pretty little eyes</font>

826
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:48,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll melt, just like
Mummy and Daddy did.</font>

827
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

828
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:58,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! It is my crown!
I am the eldest!</font>

829
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:00,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jabberwocky!</font>

830
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is impossible.</font>

831
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only if you believe it is.</font>

832
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:03,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I believe as many as
6 impossible things before breakfast.</font>

833
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is an excellent practice.</font>

834
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, just at the moment,</font>

835
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:16,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you really might want to
focus on the Jabberwocky.</font>

836
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your champion, Sister?</font>

837
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:27,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

838
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Um.</font>

839
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:48,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 impossible things.
Count them, Alice.</font>

840
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:56,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, there's a potion
that can make you shrink.</font>

841
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2, and a cake that
can make you grow.</font>

842
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:09,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, my old foe, we meet on
the battlefield once again.</font>

843
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've never met.</font>

844
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not you, insignificant bearer.</font>

845
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:19,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ancient enemy,
the Vorpal one.</font>

846
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough chatter.</font>

847
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, animals can talk.</font>

848
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4, Alice,</font>

849
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:44,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cats can disappear.</font>

850
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:47,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5,</font>

851
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's a place
called Wonderland.</font>

852
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6,</font>

853
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can slay the Jabberwocky.</font>

854
01:28:23,674 --> 01:28:26,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!</font>

855
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with your head!</font>

856
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:29,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill her!</font>

857
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:32,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head.</font>

858
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you? Off with his head!</font>

859
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:22,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes against
Underland are worthy of death.</font>

860
01:32:24,623 --> 01:32:28,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, that is
against my vows,</font>

861
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:31,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">therefore, you are
banished to the Outlands.</font>

862
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:36,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one is to show you any kindness,
or ever speak a word to you.</font>

863
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:42,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will not have a
friend in the world.</font>

864
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:48,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, I hope you
bear me no ill will.</font>

865
01:32:51,942 --> 01:32:54,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne,</font>

866
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are to join
Iracebeth in banishment</font>

867
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:59,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from this day until
the end of Underland.</font>

868
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:04,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least we have each other.</font>

869
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:22,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, please! Kill me!
Please!</font>

870
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:25,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do not owe you a kindness.</font>

871
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:28,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take off my head!
- He tried to kill me.</font>

872
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:31,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Majesty! Please! Please!
- He tried to kill me.</font>

873
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:33,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I offer you my head!
- He tried to kill me!</font>

874
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:36,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the Frabjous Day!
Callou! Callay!</font>

875
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:46,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.</font>

876
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:37,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood of the Jabberwocky. You
have our everlasting gratitude.</font>

877
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for your efforts
on our behalf...</font>

878
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will this take me home?
- If that is what you choose.</font>

879
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:16,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could stay.</font>

880
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:23,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What an idea. A crazy,
mad, wonderful idea.</font>

881
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't.</font>

882
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:36,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are questions I have to
answer, things I have to do.</font>

883
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be back again
before you know it.</font>

884
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:51,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't remember me.</font>

885
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I will.
How could I forget?</font>

886
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:03,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter, why is a raven
like a writing desk?</font>

887
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:07,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't the slightest idea.</font>

888
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fairfarren, Alice.</font>

889
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:05,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She left me standing
there without an answer.</font>

890
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:07,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A case of nerves, no doubt.</font>

891
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:12,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Alice.
- Lord, Good Lord.</font>

892
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:15,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you all right?
- What happened to you?</font>

893
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:18,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fell down a hole
and hit my head.</font>

894
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:23,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.</font>

895
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:28,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's that trouble
with your digestion.</font>

896
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:33,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Margaret, but this is my
life. I'll decide what to do with it.</font>

897
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:40,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky to have my
sister for your wife, Lowell,</font>

898
01:37:40,647 --> 01:37:44,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you be good to her. I'll
be watching very closely.</font>

899
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:49,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no prince,
Aunt Imogene.</font>

900
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:52,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to talk to someone
about these delusions.</font>

901
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:58,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.</font>

902
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Mother,</font>

903
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find something useful
to do with my life.</font>

904
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:10,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two remind me of some
funny boys I met in a dream.</font>

905
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:16,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.</font>

906
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I have
business to discuss.</font>

907
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we speak in the study?</font>

908
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. And one more thing.</font>

909
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:43,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,</font>

910
01:38:44,002 --> 01:38:46,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't think he was
looking far enough.</font>

911
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:48,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not go all the way to China?</font>

912
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:54,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's vast, the culture is rich, and
we have a foothold in Hong Kong.</font>

913
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:58,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be the first to trade with
China, can you imagine it?</font>

914
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:02,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if anybody else
had said that to me,</font>

915
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:05,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say, "You've
lost your senses."</font>

916
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:07,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I've seen that look before.</font>

917
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:12,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as you're not going
to be my daughter-in-law,</font>

918
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:16,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perhaps you'd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company.</font>

919
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Absolem.</font>

920
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tripping out, spinning around.</i></font>

921

922
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:26,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah, I fell down.</i></font>

923
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:33,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm freaking out
Where am I now?</i></font>

924
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:39,700
