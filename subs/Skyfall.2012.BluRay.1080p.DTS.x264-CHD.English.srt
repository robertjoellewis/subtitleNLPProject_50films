what it all means.

You believe that?

we don't have a clue
who took the list

with some simple

Just tell me the first word
that pops into your head.

For example, I might say "Day"
and you might say...

I'm sorry, have we met before?

I'm the one who
should say "sorry".

369
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,708
It was only four ribs.

Well, you gave it

That was hardly my best shot.

I'm not sure I
could survive your best.

380

I doubt you'll get the chance.

If they do ever let
you back out there,

382
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,159
warn me first.

383
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,496
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition,

384
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,498
and then I'll be
back in the field.

385

Yes, of course.

It's not for everyone.

Ah, 007. It's this way.

389
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,595
In your defense,
a moving target is
much harder to hit.

390
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,265
Then you better keep moving.

goes up in smoke

392

thing survives.

405

I'll be outside.

406
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,981
I only have one question.

407
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,567
Why not stay dead?

408
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:56,280
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

409

Not many field
agents get to leave
this cleanly.

Do you get out
in the field much?

411
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,165
You don't need
to be an operative
to see the obvious.

412
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,793
It's a young man's game.

413
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,587
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

414
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:14,006
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

415
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,093
The only shame would
be not admitting it
until it's too late.

416
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,180
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

he's ready.

Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

419
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,647
What exactly are you implying?

420
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,649
You're sentimental about him.

421
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:36,821
As long as I'm head
of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

We've analyzed
the shrapnel fragments.

426
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,095
You're lucky it
wasn't a direct hit

427
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,555
or it would have
cut you in half.

428
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:05,975
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

extremely expensive,

430

and only used by a select few.

431
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:14,150

432
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,069
Him.

433
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,489
TANNER: Okay. Name's Patrice.

434
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,033
He's a ghost.
No known residence
or country of origin.

435
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,744
So how do we find him?

436
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,080
Well, luckily, we still have
one or two
friends left in the CIA.

437
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,999
They're after him for
the Yemeni ambassador's
murder,

438
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,876
and they're getting close.

439

going to be in Shanghai

440
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,921
in two days time,
probably on a job.

441
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,674
You're to go there
and await
further instructions.

442
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,760
If he turns up, he's yours.

443
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,221
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

444
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:46,390
Then terminate him,
for Ronson.

445
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,017
With pleasure.

446
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,686
Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

447
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,481
No.

448
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,359
Report to
the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

He hasn't set up
shop yet, but Tanner will

450
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,031
put you two together.

Yes, ma'am.

455
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,550

passed the tests.

I'm your new Quartermaster.

00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,612
You must be joking.

468
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,823
Why, because I'm not
wearing a lab coat?

469
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,950
Because you still have spots.

470

My complexion is
hardly relevant.

471

Well, your competence is.

Age is no
guarantee of efficiency.

it's gone perfectly, but...

You'll forgive me
for not putting
up the bunting.

You're hurt. You're hurt.

What have they done to you?

What have they done to you?

Free both of us...

with the same bullet.

1300
02:12:02,958 --> 02:12:04,126
Do it.

1301
02:12:04,709 --> 02:12:05,836
Do it.

1302
02:12:07,963 --> 02:12:09,172
Only you can do it.

1303
02:12:09,965 --> 02:12:11,216
Do it.

007. What took you so long?

02:13:09,566 --> 02:13:12,527
Well, I got into
some deep water.

Oh!

02:13:28,543 --> 02:13:30,629
I suppose it's...

1315
02:13:31,046 --> 02:13:33,381
too late to make a run for it?

1316
02:13:39,554 --> 02:13:41,473
Well, I'm game if you are.

1317
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:54,236
I did get one thing right.

1318
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,779
Wow.

1319
02:15:21,031 --> 02:15:23,199
I didn't even know
you could come up here.

1320

Hate to waste a view.

I can see why.

1322
02:15:30,248 --> 02:15:33,126
I thought you
were going back out
on active service.

1323

I declined.

You said it yourself,

I feel a lot safer.

Her will was read today.

She left you this.

1329
02:16:07,494 --> 02:16:10,372
Maybe it was her
way of telling you
to take a desk job.

1330
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:12,999
Just the opposite.
