00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,940
CITY OF GOD

2
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:10,590
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,269
Get that chicken!

4
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,707
If Li'l Zé catches you,
he'll kill you.

5
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:30,545
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.

6
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,505
Get that chicken!

7
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,848
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

8
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,808
Get that chicken!

9
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,895
Shit! The cops!

10
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,314
Hell, don't fucking run off!

11
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,233
Give me that.

12
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,570
Hey, Melonhead!
You fucking fag!

13
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,866
<i>A picture could change my life,</i>

14
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,328
<i>but in the City of God,
if you run away, they get you,</i>

15
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,997
<i>and if you stay, they get you too.</i>

16
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,669
<i>It's been that way
ever since I was a kid.</i>

17
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,392
You're useless, man!

18
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:28,687
- Go get the ball!
- Fucking useless!

19
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,819
Hey, kid!
Give me the ball. I wanna play.

20
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,198
You wanna mess with me?

21
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,120
Fuck off.
What's your name?

22
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,331
<i>Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.</i>

23
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:51,418
- I'm Rocket.
- Some advice, Rocket...

24
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:54,671
Don't let Li'l Dice touch that ball.
He sucks.

25
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:57,173
You lose, pal.

26
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,759
<i>That's Shaggy.</i>

27
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,888
<i>To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.</i>

28
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,474
...eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

29
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,560
<i>But in order to tell Shaggy's story,</i>

30
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:11,187
<i>I must tell the story
of the Tender Trio.</i>

31
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,815
Well, Shaggy?
The gas truck's coming.

32
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,194
- What are you fucking around for?
- You're not gonna chicken out.

33
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,960
<i>The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.</i>

34
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,587
<i>Shaggy,</i>

35
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:37,797
<i>Clipper</i>

36
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,216
<i>and Goose.</i>

37
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:47,057
<i>Tagging along were always Li'l Dice
and Benny, Shaggy's brother.</i>

38
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,978
<i>I never had the courage
to follow my brother.</i>

39
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,572
OK, let's go.

40
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:07,577
- Come on, Goose.
- Let's go!

41
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,677
Stop this fucker!

42
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,305
Stop or I'll shoot, motherfucker!

43
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:30,100
Get out!

44
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:36,356
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

45
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:39,234
Who wants gas?

46
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:51,329
More! You wanna die
for your boss's damn money?

47
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,498
Shitloads of money here!

48
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,961
You see, asshole?

49
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,298
Fuck! The cops!

50
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,603
Clear out! Everything is fucked up.

51
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:47,177
<i>Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio</i>

52
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:50,388
<i>were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.</i>

53
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,266
Here! Buy some new balls.

54
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,937
<i>But they were just amateurs.</i>

55
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,734
<i>Even my brother, Goose.</i>

56
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:04,944
Give this money to Dad.

57
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,700
But don't tell him it's from me.
OK?

58
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,037
- Hey, Stringy!
- Yeah?

59
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:17,123
- Let's go.
- Look how much I've got.

60
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:37,769
<i>We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.</i>

61
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:41,022
<i>Many families were homeless</i>

62
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:45,318
<i>due to flooding
and acts of arson in the slums.</i>

63
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:48,363
A street light!
We'll have electricity!

64
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,740
<i>The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.</i>

65
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:54,077
<i>Homeless? Off to City of God!</i>

66
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:58,206
<i>There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.</i>

67
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:02,252
<i>But for the powerful,
our problems didn't matter.</i>

68
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,963
<i>We were too far removed</i>

69
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:07,924
<i>from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.</i>

70
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:27,026
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

71
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,070
I don't know.

72
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:32,115
Being a lifeguard
is better than a fishmonger.

73
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,742
I don't want to sell fish. It stinks.

74
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,620
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.

75
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:41,332
So what do you want to be?

76
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,376
I don't know.

77
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:47,171
- Not a hood or a policeman.
- Why not?

78
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:48,798
I'm scared of getting shot.

79
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,723
Put that thing away, kid.

80
00:09:56,848 --> 00:10:00,351
Are you nuts?
Pointing that gun at me?

81
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,855
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li'l Dice is with me.

82
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,025
Right, I'm a gangster too.

83
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,985
That gas truck didn't bring much.

84
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,154
So what?
We rob gas trucks every day.

85
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,323
One today, another tomorrow.

86
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,908
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.

87
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,620
That's the only way to get outta here.

88
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:22,165
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

89
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,666
That's it.

90
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,378
The little fart's getting
too big for his britches!

91
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:37,847
He gets high
and starts talking bullshit.

92
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:42,226
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

93
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:47,523
What you got in mind, Li'l Dice?

94
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,278
<i>To be a real hood you need more
than just a gun. You need ideas.</i>

95
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,533
<i>And Li'l Dice had them.</i>

96
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,663
- Is that the motel?
- Yeah.

97
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:06,376
We grab the money and get out.
No killing.

98
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:09,921
- I need this.
- Don't touch my gun.

99
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,882
- Don't do that again.
- Don't point at me.

100
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,509
Don't point your finger at me!

101
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:17,011
Stop acting like a baby!

102
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,097
Here's yours.

103
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,641
Awesome!
Let's go!

104
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,352
- Not so fast!
- What?

105
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:28,147
You stay here and keep watch.

106
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:32,985
If the cops come,
shoot that window over there.

107
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,613
- Why me? Let that dork do that.
- Calm down.

108
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:40,868
I gave you this great plan for free
while that guy's absolutely useless!

109
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,829
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!

110
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:45,498
You're just a kid, remember?

111
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,667
You cover us, OK?

112
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:49,919
Let's go.

113
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:54,841
You'll get your turn.
Stop trying to rush things.

114
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,801
You stay there.

115
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,222
EXIT

116
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,183
This is a hold-up, bitch.

117
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,064
You should be studying or working.

118
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:15,194
You don't look like hoodlums.
You can't even tell.

119
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,573
You should be working, studying.

120
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:21,451
Shut up! What a pain in the ass!

121
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,287
OK, Clipper?

122
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,623
Shall we go in?

123
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,297
I didn't order anything.

124
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:39,594
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

125
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,013
Keep calm. All I want is your cash.

126
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,848
- Don't point that...
- Your wallet...

127
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:57,862
Hey, man.

128
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,198
What kind of whorehouse is this?

129
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:06,913
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.

130
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,082
Give it to me!

131
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:13,669
Slut!

132
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:15,630
You're fat and flabby!

133
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,883
Wanna take her place?

134
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,515
What's going on?

135
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,852
- The cops!
- Let's beat it!

136
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:36,192
Take that car.
I'll go get Li'l Dice.

137
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,656
Jesus, what a car!

138
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,039
Something fucked up.
Li'l Dice is gone.

139
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,667
The cops are shooting. Let's go!

140
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,405
Slow down! Hold on.
You said you knew how to drive.

141
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,032
I do, so cool it!

142
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,909
Turn! Watch out!

143
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,301
You fucking asshole!

144
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:47,221
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

145
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,848
No-one saw anything.

146
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:52,768
So keep your mouths shut,
understand?

147
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,315
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

148
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,191
Goose fucked up his ankle.

149
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:01,402
- What happened?
- It fucking hurts.

150
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:05,448
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.

151
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:08,326
- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.

152
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,082
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

153
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:19,295
<i>Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.</i>

154
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,006
<i>But it's not yet time
to tell his story.</i>

155
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,302
It fucking hurts, Goose.

156
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,179
Shut up.

157
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:33,059
You sound like a damn sissy, man.

158
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:38,606
Climb up!

159
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,232
No-one saw anything?

160
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:45,363
How odd! A car crashes into a bar
and no-one saw a thing.

161
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:48,574
I suppose
you didn't see anything either?

162
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,955
As usual, no-one saw,
no-one knows.

163
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,291
So what's up, Shorty?

164
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,544
They're hiding in the woods.

165
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,755
Hello, Melonhead.

166
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,634
I have this feeling
that they're out in the woods.

167
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,097
- The motherfuckers.
- They're out in the woods.

168
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:14,725
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

169
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,983
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

170
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:24,402
Fucking jungle.

171
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,701
- They stole a fortune at that motel.
- I know.

172
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,331
What if we took the money?

173
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,459
Are you crazy?

174
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,545
I'm not getting mixed up in that.

175
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,672
I want to exterminate these guys.

176
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:49,719
What? Since when is stealing
from niggers and thieves a crime?

177
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,929
It won't be hard to nab them.

178
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:56,058
I have a stoolie in the City.

179
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:25,504
Did you hear those shots?

180
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,050
If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

181
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,520
Maracana!

182
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,065
Open the door.

183
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,529
- What's the matter?
- The cops are after me.

184
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,789
Shaggy!

185
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:06,003
The cops are on my ass!
Hide me!

186
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,380
Quick, come in.

187
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,597
Shit.

188
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,475
I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

189
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:23,145
I had a vision, Goose.

190
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,941
You been smoking something?

191
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,486
- You've had a job, right?
- Yeah.

192
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,780
What's it like?
What do people say?

193
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:39,078
I worked with my father.
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

194
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,664
You know what, Goose?

195
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,125
I'm getting out.
I don't want to die.

196
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,752
This gangster's life isn't for me.

197
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,713
Wait!
The cops are still down there.

198
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,174
I don't give a shit.

199
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,721
I'm going back to the church.

200
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:02,434
<i>I will say of the Lord,</i>

201
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,774
<i>he is my refuge and my fortress,
in him will I trust.</i>

202
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,819
<i>Fear not the terror by night,</i>

203
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:15,781
<i>nor the arrow that flies by day.</i>

204
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,825
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!

205
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,369
Stop, or I'll shoot!

206
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:30,379
<i>...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.</i>

207
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:35,301
<i>The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.</i>

208
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:38,345
<i>The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.</i>

209
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,016
I don't think this guy
was involved in the heist.

210
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,976
See here?

211
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:48,272
- He's a worker, not a hoodlum.
- I'll make him one now.

212
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:56,989
<i>Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.</i>

213
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:02,953
<i>Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.</i>

214
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:07,041
<i>And Goose was in my father's hands.</i>

215
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,545
Why do you do these things?
You think I'm a fool?

216
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,673
From now on, you'll work with me.

217
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,011
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

218
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:24,225
If I catch you
with money that isn't yours,

219
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,060
I'll kill you.

220
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,603
That goes for you, too.

221
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,897
Get changed!
You start work immediately.

222
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,444
<i>Having a hood as a brother sucks.</i>

223
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,863
<i>You always end up footing the bill.</i>

224
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,657
Don't worry.

225
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:45,788
Dad's mad at me,
but he'll get over it.

226
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,878
Give me that, Rocket.
It's not for you.

227
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,506
- You have to study.
- Getting shot doesn't scare you?

228
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,466
I'm a hood because I got no brain.

229
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:02,054
But you're smart.
You should study.

230
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,808
I go to school
because I don't like physical work.

231
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,268
Promise me something...

232
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:11,188
That you'll never touch this gun.
Promise?

233
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,815
Let's shake.

234
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,528
We'd better hurry.

235
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,074
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.

236
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,118
You grinned when I got slapped.

237
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,203
- Who, me?
- I saw you.

238
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:57,818
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

239
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,446
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

240
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,781
I'm thinking of what to say to you.

241
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,328
You're thinking, as well?
Don't. It'll be your downfall.

242
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:12,041
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

243
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,585
Are you pulling my leg?

244
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,297
You never heard
of love at first sight?

245
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,175
Hoods don't love,
they desire.

246
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,510
You criticise everything I say.

247
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,598
Hoods don't talk,
they smooth-talk.

248
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:31,101
Well, I'll stop
wasting my breath on you.

249
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:35,689
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

250
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,275
Talking about love with you
sure is complicated.

251
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,154
It's not love, it's a con game.

252
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,422
It's just that I love you.

253
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,635
You just might end up convincing me.

254
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,992
<i>After the hold-up,</i>

255
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:32,621
<i>there were constant police raids
in the slum.</i>

256
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:43,757
<i>Every day, someone got beaten up,
someone was nailed.</i>

257
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,761
<i>But no-one had seen anything.</i>

258
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,680
<i>No-one knew anything.</i>

259
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,809
<i>No-one blabbed to the cops</i>

260
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,854
<i>about where the thieves
were hiding out.</i>

261
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,276
Shaggy.

262
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,946
Why don't you change your life?

263
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,950
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

264
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,078
- Good-for-nothing!
- What do you mean?

265
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:16,707
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

266
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:20,669
That's right, Shaggy.
What do you think I do all day?

267
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,966
Take it easy, baby.

268
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,429
You know all I want is to be with you,
have kids

269
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:35,058
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

270
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:39,521
Sure! For me,
that's nothing but smooth talk.

271
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:53,327
What? I almost got rich
with that motel job.

272
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,953
Are you kidding?

273
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:59,500
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

274
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,837
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

275
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,466
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.

276
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,677
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.

277
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:14,556
I bet it's those fucking policemen,
and I'm the one taking the rap.

278
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:18,268
They even nabbed Li'l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

279
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:22,773
- I don't care who did it.
- It wasn't me.

280
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,483
Let me just say.

281
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:28,278
I don't want my kid's father
to be a hoodlum. You're all alone.

282
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,988
- All alone?
- That's right!

283
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,699
- Clipper's gone religious.
- Hallelujah!

284
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,493
- Goose is working.
- Ass-kisser!

285
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,079
- And you?
- I haven't changed. So what?

286
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:41,416
They've deserted me, that's all.

287
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,961
Then I'm deserting you too.

288
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,755
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

289
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,050
Otherwise I'll go alone.

290
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,358
Fish for sale!

291
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:10,821
<i>My brother had promised
to stop messing around.</i>

292
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,949
<i>But a hood doesn't stop.</i>

293
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,660
<i>A hood takes a break.</i>

294
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,622
<i>Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.</i>

295
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:25,669
I have trout.
But for special customers like you,

296
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,839
I also have a kisser fish.

297
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,383
Hey, that's a mullet!

298
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:38,223
Doesn't your husband
go down on you?

299
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,018
No.

300
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:44,438
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

301
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,398
For about half an hour.

302
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,151
And from behind?
Do you let him?

303
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,738
Good God, no.
Doesn't it hurt?

304
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,865
The first few times.

305
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,785
Then you'll see, it's fantastic.
But you need a banana.

306
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,245
What for?

307
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,874
You're missing
the good things in life, girl!

308
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,835
You take a banana, warm it up...

309
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,297
Put it up your thing,
while he takes you from behind.

310
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,966
It's a real rush!

311
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,010
Ask your husband.

312
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:18,680
I couldn't. You don't know him.

313
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,724
He's liable to beat me.

314
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:25,145
Try him.
Men go wild for smut like that.

315
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,861
Motherfucking nigger!

316
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,408
Slut!

317
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,745
Whoring bitch!

318
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:48,960
Rocket, give me your shorts.

319
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,546
Take them off, damn it!

320
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:55,509
- No way I'm getting naked!
- You want your brother to die?

321
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:59,638
- Give me your shorts!
- Give me your shirt.

322
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,143
Your shorts! Hurry up!

323
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,316
I knew it. It's always me
who forks out for that bum.

324
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:22,369
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

325
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,913
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.

326
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:31,962
Fish! Fish for sale!

327
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,465
Hey, kid, come over here.

328
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,886
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.

329
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,681
- Get in.
- I didn't do anything.

330
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,016
- Get in!
- What about my fish?

331
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,309
Hurry it up, kid!

332
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:50,939
- I don't want to lose my fish!
- Forget your fish. Give me that.

333
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,441
Get in.

334
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:56,361
- My father will kill me.
- That doesn't matter.

335
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,958
Let's go. There's nothing here.

336
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,171
<i>That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.</i>

337
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,131
Let's go, Felipe.

338
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:20,427
<i>And he never did.</i>

339
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,512
<i>No-one ever saw him
in the slum again.</i>

340
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:27,851
<i>The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.</i>

341
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,811
Li'l Dice?

342
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:33,356
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

343
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:36,276
You're fucking loaded!

344
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:40,614
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.

345
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:44,451
Fuck you.
Cut the crap and give me the money.

346
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,577
Benny.

347
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:49,539
Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

348
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:51,625
I'm leaving the slum.

349
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,461
<i>But Shorty had his hands full.</i>

350
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,935
Let's go see, Stringy.

351
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,657
<i>A neighbour called the police
before sunrise.</i>

352
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,827
<i>The tabloids went to town.</i>

353
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:30,455
<i>"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God."</i>

354
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,042
<i>Along with reporters,
the place was swarming with cops.</i>

355
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,254
<i>The hoodlums took off.</i>

356
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,131
You wanna die?

357
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:43,760
It's you who's gonna die
if you don't do what I say.

358
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,054
And show the lady more respect.

359
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,016
Let's go, damn it!

360
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:53,228
- There are cops ahead.
- Fuck them, let's go.

361
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:57,148
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.

362
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,985
What's the matter?

363
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,154
Have mercy!
This car is a piece of junk.

364
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,368
- My ass! Start the damn thing!
- It needs a push.

365
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,829
Push, Shaggy!

366
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,289
Push!

367
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:29,347
You? I don't understand.

368
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:33,435
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there.

369
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,062
Nab that guy over there!

370
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,423
Run, Shaggy!

371
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,801
Stop the car!

372
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,221
This way! He's over here.

373
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,518
We got that son of a bitch!

374
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:12,450
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.

375
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:17,163
<i>On the day Shaggy died,
I remember the crowds</i>

376
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:20,250
<i>and a camera.</i>

377
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,128
<i>I'd always wanted to have one.</i>

378
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:27,340
Let's go to school.

379
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,685
- Well?
- Let's go to the beach.

380
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,688
- But we have an exam.
- So what?

381
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:47,110
Everyone else is at the beach.

382
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:49,946
Come on, let's go!

383
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:53,867
She's in a bikini,
but doesn't want to go.

384
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:59,080
What's that saying you have?

385
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,208
The sun is for everyone,
the beach for those who deserve it.

386
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,592
<i>I bought my first camera
when I was 16.</i>

387
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,678
<i>Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom</i>

388
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,556
<i>with the world's cheapest model.</i>

389
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,643
So, Rocket? How are things going?

390
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:24,898
- Any luck getting laid yet?
- None.

391
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:29,277
<i>Angelica, I was crazy about her.</i>

392
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,030
So, Rocket, still clicking away?

393
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:36,117
<i>She was gorgeous and the only girl
in our gang who screwed.</i>

394
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,328
<i>I wanted to lose my virginity with her.</i>

395
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,205
With her, buddy?

396
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,082
She's got a guy.

397
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:45,043
- So? I'm not jealous.
- Her dad's a sergeant.

398
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,212
No-one's perfect.

399
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,547
Closer together!

400
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:53,134
<i>I was the official photographer
of our gang.</i>

401
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,761
<i>The gang of groovies.</i>

402
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:59,140
<i>Everyone paid
to have copies of the pictures.</i>

403
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:08,608
Tiago, move back a little.

404
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:09,901
Is this OK?

405
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,611
Perfect.

406
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,579
I need a joint.

407
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:26,584
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It's far out.

408
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:30,672
You snort, Tiago?
I prefer a good toke.

409
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,344
If you like, I can get it for you.

410
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:41,015
You can?
Then go on, move your ass!

411
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:45,145
But the choice stuff is coke.
That's a real narcotic.

412
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,105
Narcotic!

413
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:53,862
- Your mouth is all salty, Tiago.
- Screw you.

414
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,739
You want to be a lifeguard, Stringy?

415
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,325
- You're never in the water.
- What?

416
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,329
- I'll bet you a beer I swim better.
- You're on.

417
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:10,086
If you like,
I can go get you a joint at Blacky's.

418
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,227
<i>I'd have done anything to please her.</i>

419
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,105
<i>Buy her pot, coke.</i>

420
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:39,824
<i>I could go to the top dogs
to buy quality stuff at a good price</i>

421
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:47,165
<i>because the local boss
was a former classmate, Blacky.</i>

422
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,500
Who is it?

423
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,628
Rocket.

424
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,381
Come in.

425
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,592
- How are things down there?
- Fine.

426
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:00,136
- And the kids?
- Fine too.

427
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,263
- You want to buy or smoke a joint?
- Buy.

428
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,224
Come in, buddy.

429
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,230
Who is it?

430
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:20,198
<i>This was Blacky's turf.</i>

431
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:23,826
<i>But it hadn't always been his.</i>

432
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,706
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

433
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,792
You show up like this at my place?

434
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,086
Who said it was your place?

435
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:40,468
<i>Dona Zelia began selling drugs here</i>

436
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:44,681
<i>in order to raise her daughters.</i>

437
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:47,350
<i>She also gave away drugs
to boys at times</i>

438
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:50,478
<i>in return for special favours.</i>

439
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:53,022
<i>Her favourite was "Big Boy".</i>

440
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:56,192
<i>One day, he grew very big!</i>

441
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,653
<i>Zelia's operation was so amateur</i>

442
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:02,240
<i>that he had no trouble
seizing it from her.</i>

443
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:07,245
<i>Big Boy used
the neighbourhood kids as dealers.</i>

444
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,791
- What about my pot?
- Stick it up your ass.

445
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,669
<i>The best dealer...</i>

446
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,296
I sold everything.

447
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:19,090
<i>...was a guy called Carrot.</i>

448
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:22,010
Can I have a sip?

449
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,929
<i>He earned Big Boy's trust</i>

450
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:28,057
<i>and moved up to become a manager.</i>

451
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:31,185
Blacky, 20 for us and 5 for you, OK?

452
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:36,399
<i>One day
a buddy of Carrot's showed up.</i>

453
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:40,361
<i>His name was Aristotle.</i>

454
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,405
My wife needs an operation.

455
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,868
<i>His family had taken Carrot in</i>

456
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,078
<i>when he was down and out.</i>

457
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:51,914
<i>He couldn't refuse
to help a brother in need.</i>

458
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,753
Here's the dope. I want the dough
no later than Friday.

459
00:38:56,878 --> 00:39:00,131
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.

460
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:04,093
He's my buddy.
Practically my brother, Big Boy.

461
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:08,056
Give him another week.

462
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,102
Either you kill him or I'll kill you.

463
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:14,729
<i>Carrot had no choice.</i>

464
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,732
- Hear the news? I got a job.
- I said Friday.

465
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,276
Don't do it, man.

466
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:25,406
<i>Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.</i>

467
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:29,327
<i>Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.</i>

468
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:31,287
We got them!

469
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:36,334
<i>Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy,</i>

470
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:39,754
<i>but didn't want the apartment.</i>

471
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,381
<i>The place was ill-fated.</i>

472
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:44,008
<i>Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...</i>

473
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,134
<i>150 bags.</i>

474
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:46,427
<i>...Blacky.</i>

475
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,430
We can sell loads.

476
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,975
<i>That's how he took over
the local trade.</i>

477
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,103
<i>But not for long.</i>

478
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,356
Who is it?

479
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:00,858
Go see.

480
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,955
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

481
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,915
You show up like this at my place?

482
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,459
Who said it was your place?

483
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,962
Yeah, who?

484
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,176
Li'l Dice?

485
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:30,596
Li'l Dice, my ass.
My name is Li'l Zé now.

486
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,310
<i>Li'l Zé had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God,</i>

487
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:41,149
<i>ever since he was called Li'l Dice.</i>

488
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:48,281
They're having fun, and not me?

489
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,375
I want to get out of here.

490
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:04,881
What, kid? Your friend took everything.
What do you want?

491
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:14,265
<i>That night, Li'l Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill,</i>

492
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,726
<i>though he knew
Shaggy would never forgive him.</i>

493
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:28,738
<i>To avoid being punished,
he left the City of God.</i>

494
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,825
<i>He had to work hard for peanuts.</i>

495
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:36,913
- What's with you, kid?
- You're an idiot.

496
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:38,206
Yeah, Benny!

497
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,958
<i>Li'l Dice and Benny managed well.</i>

498
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,754
<i>They had the gift of crime.</i>

499
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:48,341
- You have more than me.
- It was my idea.

500
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:51,177
<i>The only problem
was running into an older hoodlum</i>

501
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:52,720
<i>like my brother Goose.</i>

502
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:54,639
Li'l Dice?

503
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:58,267
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

504
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:01,145
You're fucking loaded!

505
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,358
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.

506
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:07,860
Fuck you. Pass me the money!

507
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:12,865
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

508
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,492
I'm leaving the slum.

509
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:19,038
Goose!

510
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,377
Take it. From Shaggy.
You'll need it.

511
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,191
<i>From one hit to the next,
Li'l Dice grew up.</i>

512
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:51,696
<i>At 18, he was the most respected hood
in the City of God.</i>

513
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:53,823
You're of age now, watch out!

514
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:57,201
<i>He was one of
the most wanted robbers in Rio.</i>

515
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,300
Li'l Dice, how's it going?

516
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:16,429
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18.

517
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:18,973
- Get lost, Tuba!
- Excuse me, <i>amigo.</i>

518
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:22,602
Give me a beer!

519
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:25,813
Didn't you see me, prick?
You didn't see me?

520
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:26,939
What's up, man?

521
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:32,153
Up yours! The next time,
I'll waste you, asshole!

522
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:38,534
<i>Li'l Dice was ready for anything.</i>

523
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,703
I wanna talk.

524
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,330
<i>And he was itching to start.</i>

525
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:45,583
- Who are the fattest cats here?
- There are tons of them.

526
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,126
Look at Jerry Adriani.

527
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:52,173
Gold chain, snazzy clothes.

528
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:55,217
Look at Pereira
and the chick he's with.

529
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:58,012
Bernice. She was my brother's girl.

530
00:43:58,137 --> 00:43:59,972
Check out his car.

531
00:44:00,097 --> 00:44:04,101
Then there's Blacky.
Covered in gold.

532
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:07,063
Gold chain, gold watch.

533
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:10,358
Look at Carrot, and his car.

534
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:12,234
They're all dealers.

535
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,236
They're all fucking loaded.

536
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:18,783
Hold-ups bring in chicken shit.
The big bucks are in drugs.

537
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:21,702
- I see.
- Especially in selling coke.

538
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:24,330
- But you need money.
- Not really.

539
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:28,334
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

540
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:31,045
- When do we start?
- Now.

541
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:44,600
Exu-the-Devil
is the light that shines forth.

542
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,436
He brought you here.

543
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:52,733
Why remain in the City of God,
where God has forgotten you?

544
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,445
I know what you want.

545
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,072
You want power.

546
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:02,243
I have something
which will give it to you.

547
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:08,374
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

548
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,169
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet,

549
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,839
otherwise...

550
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,300
...you'll die.

551
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:23,472
The boy is no longer called Li'l Dice,
but Li'l Zé.

552
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:27,184
Li'l Zé will grow up.

553
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:31,313
You'll stick with me,
I'll stick with you.

554
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,203
<i>Li'l Dice became Li'l Zé
and he began to kill.</i>

555
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:51,459
<i>He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.</i>

556
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:54,086
<i>He spent all day on the job.</i>

557
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:59,467
<i>By night, almost all of the rackets
in the slum were his.</i>

558
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:02,720
<i>The only business
he didn't touch was Carrot's,</i>

559
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:04,805
<i>since he was a friend of Benny's.</i>

560
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,434
<i>All that was left was the apartment.
But that would be easy.</i>

561
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,648
Who is it?

562
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:17,985
Go see.

563
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:24,867
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

564
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:26,994
You show up like this at my place?

565
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,580
Who said it was your place?

566
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:32,208
- Yeah, who?
- Something wrong, Li'l Dice?

567
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:35,544
Li'l Dice, my ass.
My name is Li'l Zé now.

568
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:36,670
Li'l Zé, see?

569
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:40,049
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.

570
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,175
Right, Blacky?

571
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,470
It's all yours.

572
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:47,139
I don't want no trouble, OK?

573
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:50,392
<i>I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.</i>

574
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:56,106
You'll live, but you'll work for us.

575
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,233
Understand?

576
00:46:57,358 --> 00:46:58,776
<i>That's easy to say.</i>

577
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:03,239
- Where are you going?
- He's clean, Li'l Zé.

578
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,908
What's your name, kid?

579
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:09,829
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.

580
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:12,039
- Goose?
- The late Goose.

581
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:17,002
Quick, kid. Run along.

582
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:20,881
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li'l Zé.

583
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:24,885
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

584
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,846
Cocaine.

585
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:33,018
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.

586
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:36,146
<i>Selling drugs
is like any other business.</i>

587
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,399
<i>The supplier
delivers the merchandise,</i>

588
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:41,318
<i>which is then packaged
on the premises.</i>

589
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:45,614
<i>It's done in an assembly line.</i>

590
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:48,576
<i>Boring as hell.</i>

591
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:52,246
<i>Pot is wrapped up in "lids".</i>

592
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:55,207
<i>Cocaine is put into packets,</i>

593
00:47:55,332 --> 00:48:00,170
<i>and then into bundles of 10 or 100.</i>

594
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,673
<i>You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.</i>

595
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:07,511
<i>The kids start out as delivery boys.</i>

596
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:12,433
<i>They're paid to run errands
and take messages.</i>

597
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,101
<i>Then they become lookouts.</i>

598
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,644
<i>If the police arrive,</i>

599
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:18,480
<i>the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.</i>

600
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:23,944
<i>Later, you become
a dealer or a "vapour".</i>

601
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,780
<i>When the heat's on,
the "vapour" quickly evaporates.</i>

602
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:30,993
<i>Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".</i>

603
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:34,955
<i>And if the guy is good at maths,
he can become a manager,</i>

604
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,500
<i>the boss's right-hand man.</i>

605
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:43,589
<i>The police receive their part
and don't make trouble.</i>

606
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:48,844
<i>Since Li'l Zé killed off
all of his enemies,</i>

607
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,097
<i>there were no shoot-outs
in the City of God.</i>

608
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:53,849
<i>You could drive there.</i>

609
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:57,770
<i>The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.</i>

610
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:04,193
<i>The City teemed with addicts
and Li'l Zé grew rich.</i>

611
00:49:04,902 --> 00:49:07,112
- Do you want to try some?
- Cheers, mate.

612
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:14,828
- Can't decide which to wear.
- This one's cool.

613
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:17,331
<i>If dealing were legal,</i>

614
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:21,710
<i>Li'l Zé would have been
man of the year.</i>

615
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:26,340
<i>But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.</i>

616
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:28,801
<i>And he was everywhere.</i>

617
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:30,636
What a drag this guy is.

618
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:35,432
<i>Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint,
I had to go see Carrot.</i>

619
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:42,314
Half a lid.

620
00:49:42,439 --> 00:49:44,233
Thanks.

621
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:48,612
<i>But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.</i>

622
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:53,492
<i>She and Tiago had split up,
so I made my move.</i>

623
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,036
<i>I was about to win her over.</i>

624
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:59,415
These pictures are really great.

625
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,960
- You think so?
- I look good here.

626
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:05,921
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.

627
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,297
Me too.

628
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:14,972
<i>A setting sun, a deserted beach,
a long kiss.</i>

629
00:50:15,806 --> 00:50:18,142
<i>I was sure this was it.</i>

630
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:21,687
<i>But the Runts arrived.</i>

631
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:25,399
Can I have a toke?

632
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:32,740
Here.

633
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:36,660
- I'm going. See you later.
- You're leaving?

634
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:38,328
She's leaving!

635
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:40,289
Hold on, Angelica.

636
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:44,168
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.

637
00:50:44,293 --> 00:50:46,128
What a cool guy.

638
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:55,012
<i>That was my first run-in
with the Runts.</i>

639
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:03,479
- Steak and fries, Benny.
- Great!

640
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:08,025
Here.

641
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:12,863
- A tip for you.
- Really? Thanks.

642
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:14,490
- Wanna eat something?
- No.

643
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,120
Wanna trade this watch?

644
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:24,958
<i>After Angelica left him,
Tiago began snorting more and more.</i>

645
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:28,170
- Is it your grandfather's?
- No, my dad's.

646
00:51:28,295 --> 00:51:32,925
<i>When a guy is really hooked,
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.</i>

647
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,927
- Two bags often.
- One often.

648
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:36,053
OK, one bag.

649
00:51:36,178 --> 00:51:39,515
<i>For Tiago, it was different.</i>

650
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,227
- Watch out!
- Sorry, Godfather.

651
00:51:43,352 --> 00:51:46,396
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptise your kids?

652
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:49,483
- I'm sorry.
- Now beat it.

653
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:56,073
Blacky, lend me your bike.

654
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:21,974
Hey, wanna race?

655
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:26,103
- Where to?
- Up to the highway.

656
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:29,231
- OK.
- Ready? Go!

657
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:52,754
Pretty tough, wasn't it?

658
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,382
Yeah, you're good.

659
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:59,553
- Where'd you buy those sneakers?
- Not far from here.

660
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:02,639
- The shirt as well?
- No, uptown.

661
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:05,726
- Cool.
- It's a designer shirt.

662
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,020
If I give you money,
can you buy me one?

663
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:10,564
Shorts and a shirt?

664
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:14,776
Buy whatever you can.

665
00:53:18,197 --> 00:53:20,407
- What size are you?
- Measure me.

666
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:23,368
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.

667
00:53:24,995 --> 00:53:27,623
- Shoe size?
- Seven.

668
00:53:27,748 --> 00:53:29,583
Turn around.

669
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:37,925
Hey, Benny!

670
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,345
You got the digs?

671
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:48,644
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.

672
00:53:52,898 --> 00:53:55,317
- You like it?
- Yeah.

673
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:57,653
There's some change.

674
00:53:57,778 --> 00:54:01,156
- Keep it.
- Cool.

675
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:11,416
This is Benny.

676
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:16,964
- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.

677
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:43,573
I've become a playboy.

678
00:54:46,118 --> 00:54:50,330
Hey, gangsters, listen to this.

679
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:52,249
Watch out.

680
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:55,877
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

681
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:01,258
Oh, yeah?

682
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:03,385
Fuck off, you bastards!

683
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:11,393
Making fun of me?

684
00:55:12,436 --> 00:55:14,271
Asshole!

685
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:31,580
Benny, didn't I tell you
to shoot Carrot?

686
00:55:31,705 --> 00:55:33,707
He's endangering the slum.

687
00:55:33,832 --> 00:55:37,252
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm gonna kill that fucker.

688
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:40,464
- Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
- I'm gonna kill him.

689
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:45,719
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

690
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:48,597
Sure, I'm not worried.

691
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:52,059
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

692
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:57,272
Go talk to the guy.

693
00:55:57,397 --> 00:56:00,984
<i>Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.</i>

694
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:04,613
<i>He gave away pot, paid for drinks.</i>

695
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:06,406
<i>Li'l Zé was the opposite.</i>

696
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:10,077
<i>He had one obsession,
to be the boss of the slum.</i>

697
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:13,538
<i>He wanted an excuse
to take over Carrot's racket.</i>

698
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,332
- Hey, Carrot.
- What's up?

699
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:20,420
You shouldn't let the Runts
do hold-ups in the slum.

700
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:25,634
You look after your section,
I'll look after mine. Got that?

701
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:27,886
I'm gonna get a drink.

702
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:38,021
- Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
- Great.

703
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,773
- You OK?
- Good.

704
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:40,899
Your friend?

705
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:43,860
- Hey, Benny!
- How's it going?

706
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:47,072
- Hey, Tiago. How are you?
- Good.

707
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,825
- May I?
- Sure.

708
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,785
Wanna dance?

709
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:59,793
- Is it OK at your place?
- No problem.

710
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:03,004
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.

711
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,132
You can lose your virginity tonight.

712
00:57:05,257 --> 00:57:09,469
Not so loud, man!
Everyone will hear.

713
00:57:10,554 --> 00:57:13,140
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

714
00:57:13,265 --> 00:57:14,766
Shit!

715
00:57:15,392 --> 00:57:17,769
Nothing's happening.

716
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,731
Shit!

717
00:57:24,985 --> 00:57:29,281
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

718
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:32,159
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?

719
00:57:32,284 --> 00:57:33,452
You want to take my racket?

720
00:57:33,577 --> 00:57:37,164
I want to talk to you
because you're fucking useless.

721
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,373
Get your hand away!

722
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:40,500
The Runts
are screwing up our security.

723
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,002
Wait, Rocket.

724
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:43,628
Give the baby his bottle.

725
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:46,256
Carrot,
just ask the kids to cool it, OK?

726
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:49,634
He's useless.
He lets the Runts do hold-ups.

727
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:52,888
The police come around,
and that's bad for business.

728
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:57,225
I'll do it only because I like you.

729
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,186
But you need to change
that baby's nappy.

730
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:01,521
I'll show you who's the baby.

731
00:58:02,898 --> 00:58:08,487
Tell the kids that in my slum
no-one robs or rapes!

732
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:10,447
No wonder you're "Little" Zé!

733
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:18,413
<i>The Runts were kids
who didn't respect the laws of the slum.</i>

734
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:22,125
<i>They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries,</i>

735
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,628
<i>especially in Carrot's section.</i>

736
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:29,174
What are you doing?

737
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:34,012
You rob me all the time!

738
00:58:34,137 --> 00:58:40,268
<i>But they didn't know
that the City had a boss now.</i>

739
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,563
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

740
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:48,026
<i>The City had become
much safer for residents.</i>

741
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,947
<i>There were hardly any hold-ups now.</i>

742
00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:54,157
<i>You just had to go see Li'l Zé.</i>

743
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:56,952
- Let's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.

744
00:58:57,077 --> 00:58:59,621
I won't touch them.

745
00:59:00,205 --> 00:59:02,374
Don't worry,
no one gets through.

746
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,252
- Hi, Steak.
- How's it going, Li'l Zé?

747
00:59:05,377 --> 00:59:09,297
- Wanna take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on.

748
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:13,718
Mum, I'm going out with my friends.

749
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:28,858
That's the best chicken I ever ate.

750
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:31,570
The old guy was scared shitless.

751
00:59:31,695 --> 00:59:34,573
Feeling sorry for him?

752
00:59:34,698 --> 00:59:36,658
You're crazy, man!

753
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:47,919
Why not stick up a bank
or a supermarket?

754
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:52,549
- Peanuts. Drugs are where it's at.
- Yeah, selling drugs.

755
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:54,259
Shut up!

756
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:57,679
But you have to start out
as a delivery boy.

757
00:59:57,804 --> 00:59:59,431
You wanna be a delivery boy?

758
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:04,686
It's a rip-off.
It takes a long time to move up.

759
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:09,065
You have to wait till
an older guy gets killed to move up.

760
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,942
I don't wanna wait
till some guy croaks.

761
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:14,904
I'm gonna do what Li'l Zé did.
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

762
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:18,491
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

763
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:24,164
Come back, you brat!

764
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:32,047
Where do you think you're going?

765
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:34,132
They're quick, those kids.

766
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:35,925
They run fast.

767
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:39,346
- They're all gone except you.
- Any others?

768
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,023
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

769
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:53,943
You choose.
Shall I shoot you in the hand or foot?

770
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:56,488
Come on, choose!

771
01:00:56,613 --> 01:00:59,407
Hand or foot?

772
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:04,829
- Choose, for fuck's sake!
- Come on!

773
01:01:09,334 --> 01:01:12,337
Come on, choose!

774
01:01:12,462 --> 01:01:15,590
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?

775
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:26,559
Cool.

776
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:32,232
Hey, Steak'n'fries,
let's see what you're made of.

777
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:35,777
Choose and then kill one of them.

778
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:39,656
- Leave it. I'll do it.
- Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

779
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:44,452
Go on, Steak.

780
01:01:44,577 --> 01:01:47,247
Go on, choose one and shoot.

781
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:51,334
Come on, I haven't got all day.

782
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:54,337
Go on, Steak,
choose one and shoot.

783
01:01:57,424 --> 01:01:59,175
Go on, I haven't got all day.

784
01:02:00,927 --> 01:02:04,264
I wanna see what you're made of.

785
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:09,519
Come on, get it over with.

786
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:11,730
Come on, I haven't got all day.

787
01:02:12,856 --> 01:02:15,275
Well done!

788
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,693
You did it.

789
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:19,863
You're one of us.

790
01:02:19,988 --> 01:02:22,699
Very good, Steak.

791
01:02:25,076 --> 01:02:30,665
Get up, brat. Go back to your rat hole.

792
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,041
Without limping!

793
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:37,380
Tell your buddies
that no-one robs in Li'l Zé's slum.

794
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:39,507
Go now. And no limping, OK?

795
01:02:57,108 --> 01:03:01,070
<i>While Li'l Zé was winning
the respect of the residents,</i>

796
01:03:01,196 --> 01:03:04,407
<i>Benny was winning Angelica's heart.</i>

797
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:09,829
<i>As for me, I was still a virgin,
single and broke.</i>

798
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:11,956
<i>I had no choice.</i>

799
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:20,173
<i>I had to take a job in a supermarket.</i>

800
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:24,886
<i>I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off</i>

801
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:29,432
<i>so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.</i>

802
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:33,102
<i>But things didn't work out that way.</i>

803
01:03:36,356 --> 01:03:39,067
- It's the guy on the beach.
- Hey, bro!

804
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:42,278
- Still smoking good stuff?
- Yeah.

805
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:43,863
That guy's too cool.

806
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,491
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

807
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:54,958
We give these kids a chance.
They don't appreciate it.

808
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:58,795
- What about my severance pay?
- What severance pay?

809
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,007
<i>That fucking manager
thought I was part of the gang.</i>

810
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:08,179
You're fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

811
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:11,891
<i>I didn't get a single cent.</i>

812
01:04:25,822 --> 01:04:27,824
<i>It was like a message from God.</i>

813
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:33,538
<i>"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."</i>

814
01:04:46,342 --> 01:04:48,845
The bus sure took a long time to come.

815
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:51,180
I should already be at work.

816
01:04:51,306 --> 01:04:54,434
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

817
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,896
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.

818
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:00,148
The company
doesn't run many buses on this line.

819
01:05:00,273 --> 01:05:01,941
It's always someone else.

820
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:06,988
It's my grandfather's fault.

821
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:08,698
And then they make us squeeze!

822
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:11,034
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

823
01:05:13,578 --> 01:05:16,789
I know that guy.
He lives in the City.

824
01:05:16,915 --> 01:05:19,000
He'll recognise us.

825
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:21,586
So? He couldn't care less
if we take his boss's money.

826
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:23,713
OK. Let's go.

827
01:05:26,174 --> 01:05:29,177
Well, boys?
Aren't you from the City of God?

828
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:32,180
Yeah.

829
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:34,974
I'll let one of you through
without paying.

830
01:05:39,312 --> 01:05:44,567
You should study
so you can get out of the slum.

831
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:47,362
- It's too full of cops and hoodlums.
- Did you study?

832
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:50,531
I was in school and in the army.

833
01:05:50,657 --> 01:05:54,077
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

834
01:05:54,202 --> 01:05:56,704
This job
was all I could find afterwards.

835
01:05:56,829 --> 01:06:01,042
But I do karate.
If I'm hired somewhere,

836
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:03,336
I'll leave the slum.

837
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:08,299
- Do you fight, then?
- I'm for peace and love.

838
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:09,926
But if I have to...

839
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:13,137
<i>He didn't know he would have to.</i>

840
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:17,183
<i>But not yet. It's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.</i>

841
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:19,936
- We should be going.
- Let's go.

842
01:06:20,061 --> 01:06:21,229
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

843
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:23,189
See you.

844
01:06:28,027 --> 01:06:30,613
I couldn't do it.
He was such a cool guy.

845
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:34,659
Yeah, totally.
That's Gerson's brother.

846
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:36,786
Let's go home.

847
01:06:39,414 --> 01:06:44,335
- No way! That bakery's empty.
- What will you say?

848
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,631
I don't know. "This is a hold-up."

849
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:51,801
Here's my number.

850
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:54,512
- You like soul or groovy?
- Soul.

851
01:06:54,637 --> 01:06:56,681
<i>That one didn't work either.</i>

852
01:06:56,806 --> 01:07:00,184
<i>The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.</i>

853
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:01,561
Will you call me?

854
01:07:02,854 --> 01:07:06,357
I couldn't pull a gun on her,
she was such a cool girl.

855
01:07:06,482 --> 01:07:08,359
Yeah, I agree.

856
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:12,530
Excuse me.

857
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:18,411
I'm lost. How do I get to Barra?

858
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:19,537
- To Barra?
- Yes.

859
01:07:19,662 --> 01:07:22,665
<i>I thought, "Tough luck
for this guy from São Paulo."</i>

860
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:26,711
- We were going there.
- You're kidding.

861
01:07:26,836 --> 01:07:30,089
- You're a lifesaver.
- That's right.

862
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:34,761
<i>Because no guy from São Paulo
could ever be cool.</i>

863
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:45,438
- The body's over here.
- We found it, chief.

864
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:47,732
The forensic expert!

865
01:08:03,081 --> 01:08:05,666
Not a pretty sight, eh?

866
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:08,086
- What a great singer.
- You like him?

867
01:08:08,211 --> 01:08:10,922
I love music. What about you?

868
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:13,549
Tell me, do you also like pot?

869
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:19,388
I can't say. I've never tried it.

870
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:22,850
The devil recognises his own.

871
01:08:24,227 --> 01:08:26,437
Do you have papers?

872
01:08:27,522 --> 01:08:31,192
- I've run out.
- I have some.

873
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:35,613
<i>I'd always been an ace
at rolling a joint.</i>

874
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:38,825
<i>If I'd had the same skill with girls,</i>

875
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:42,954
<i>I'd never have missed
so many chances to lose my virginity.</i>

876
01:08:45,081 --> 01:08:47,416
For a São Paulo guy
you're really cool.

877
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:49,836
Thanks, bro.

878
01:08:49,961 --> 01:08:52,922
What did they use?

879
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:57,218
- A club or a rock.
- And the child?

880
01:08:57,343 --> 01:09:00,471
- Untouched.
- Thank goodness.

881
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:05,935
- How long ago?
- About four hours.

882
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,645
- Can we take it away?
- Go ahead.

883
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:14,485
The murderer
has to be from the City of God.

884
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:34,839
You bastard! You motherfucker!

885
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,887
Did you have to kill
your chick in the slum?

886
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:43,014
The place is crawling with cops now!

887
01:09:43,139 --> 01:09:45,892
- Come on, Li'l Zé.
- Come on? Fuck you!

888
01:09:46,017 --> 01:09:48,936
I had to avenge my honour.

889
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:52,607
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.

890
01:09:52,732 --> 01:09:54,901
The cops are everywhere
because of you.

891
01:09:55,026 --> 01:09:57,945
- You're dead meat, asshole.
- Let up, Li'l Zé.

892
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,655
You've punished him enough.

893
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,616
You know the law.

894
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:04,744
Anyone who kills in my slum
has to die as an example.

895
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:07,455
That was his business, Li'l Zé.

896
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,166
Listen, you son of a bitch,
get outta the slum.

897
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:12,376
You showed no respect, understand?

898
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:15,588
Don't fuck up again!

899
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,215
You know what, Benny?

900
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:21,177
You're too nice. If you raise a snake,
expect to get bitten.

901
01:10:21,302 --> 01:10:24,430
He wasn't worth shit.

902
01:10:24,555 --> 01:10:27,475
- A dirty traitor.
- Shut up, Tuba.

903
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,936
I'm going for a walk with my girl.

904
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:34,523
Don't take too long, though.

905
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:38,569
When things calm down, we'll get back
to our business with Carrot, OK?

906
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:46,077
You need a girlfriend, Li'l Zé.

907
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:09,016
Know what I'm thinking, Benny?

908
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:12,311
That I'm so sexy?

909
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:16,065
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

910
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:20,111
- Make love again.
- I'm serious.

911
01:11:20,236 --> 01:11:24,949
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

912
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,535
Go where?

913
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:30,413
To a farm.

914
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:35,710
We're really hippies at heart,
aren't we?

915
01:11:37,211 --> 01:11:39,046
A farm?

916
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:45,177
Peace and love?

917
01:12:18,586 --> 01:12:22,006
<i>Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.</i>

918
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:25,926
<i>He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his goodbye party.</i>

919
01:12:26,052 --> 01:12:27,219
<i>The gangs.</i>

920
01:12:28,804 --> 01:12:30,890
<i>The soul crowd.</i>

921
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:36,645
<i>The religious crowd.</i>

922
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:38,230
I'll pay you a visit at the church.

923
01:12:38,356 --> 01:12:40,900
Thanks for coming to my party.

924
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:43,027
<i>The samba crowd.</i>

925
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:47,990
<i>The groovy crowd.</i>

926
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:55,664
<i>And Li'l Zé,
who had never danced in his life.</i>

927
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,812
- Want to dance with me?
- Huh?

928
01:13:17,937 --> 01:13:20,689
- Want to dance with me?
- I didn't hear...

929
01:13:20,815 --> 01:13:25,569
- Want to dance?
- No, thank you, I'm with someone.

930
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:41,752
Hey, Rocket!

931
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,477
Come, I want to talk to you, buddy.

932
01:14:00,104 --> 01:14:02,356
You can't just split with that chick.

933
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:07,528
Why not? I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

934
01:14:07,653 --> 01:14:11,532
You wanna throw away everything
for that bitch?

935
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:15,619
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

936
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:18,038
We'll take over Carrot's business.
It'll be yours.

937
01:14:18,164 --> 01:14:21,250
- Carrot's a good guy.
- He's a motherfucker!

938
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:25,004
Everyone's a motherfucker to you.
That's why I'm leaving.

939
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:29,049
I'm your friend.
I don't want to fight.

940
01:14:29,175 --> 01:14:31,427
You got to understand, I have to go.

941
01:14:32,553 --> 01:14:37,016
I love you, man, but I've had enough.

942
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:38,911
Motherfucker,
let's see if you have any balls.

943
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:41,413
You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

944
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:46,252
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

945
01:15:46,377 --> 01:15:50,673
Hurry up! Take it all off!

946
01:15:51,298 --> 01:15:54,426
I want to see you naked.
Take it off!

947
01:15:54,552 --> 01:15:57,221
Let's go, nigger!

948
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:10,442
Show your ass to everyone!

949
01:16:10,568 --> 01:16:12,653
Stop it, please.

950
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:17,408
You loser!

951
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:19,159
Take it off!

952
01:16:32,006 --> 01:16:33,549
What's up, Benny?

953
01:16:33,674 --> 01:16:35,426
This camera for a bag of coke?

954
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:37,386
I don't deal any more.

955
01:16:37,511 --> 01:16:40,097
Come on, do it for me.
You're my friend.

956
01:16:40,222 --> 01:16:43,142
- Is it stolen?
- It's OK, it's my dad's.

957
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:45,436
Your dad's?

958
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:49,690
Give it to Li'l Zé.

959
01:16:49,815 --> 01:16:52,484
Rocket would love this camera.

960
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,032
- Yeah, here.
- Great.

961
01:17:22,848 --> 01:17:24,808
Here I am!

962
01:17:24,933 --> 01:17:27,227
- You wanna be a photographer?
- Yeah.

963
01:17:27,353 --> 01:17:29,146
Here's a present.

964
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:32,441
Shit, dude! This is great!

965
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:35,944
Now move your ass.

966
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,404
Shake it!

967
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:58,384
You'll take some great pictures.

968
01:18:01,136 --> 01:18:03,305
Give me that.

969
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:12,147
- Give me back the camera!
- No!

970
01:18:13,691 --> 01:18:15,818
Give me back the camera!

971
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:20,781
What's your problem?
Are you crazy?

972
01:18:51,562 --> 01:18:53,564
They've killed Benny!

973
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:59,611
Fuck! Call an ambulance!

974
01:18:59,737 --> 01:19:02,448
Where's the motherfucker who did it?

975
01:19:02,573 --> 01:19:04,283
Zé, Benny is dead.

976
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:06,994
No! Call a doctor!

977
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:17,129
Get out of here, bitch!
It's your fault!

978
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:22,092
- Go away!
- Motherfucker!

979
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,577
Where's Carrot?

980
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:50,454
Blacky's here.

981
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:55,042
He's in trouble.

982
01:19:57,544 --> 01:19:59,213
I'm fucked.

983
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:03,050
- Why?
- I'm fucked. And you are too.

984
01:20:03,175 --> 01:20:07,179
I think I killed Benny.
Li'l Zé's coming to take your place.

985
01:20:07,304 --> 01:20:09,389
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

986
01:20:09,515 --> 01:20:11,475
You killed Benny?

987
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,437
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li'l Zé.

988
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:17,439
Come on, let's go.

989
01:20:17,564 --> 01:20:19,399
Blacky.

990
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:22,861
You killed the coolest hood
in the City of God.

991
01:20:22,986 --> 01:20:25,072
Let's go get Li'l Zé.

992
01:20:33,622 --> 01:20:38,460
<i>Carrot knew that without Benny
only a miracle could save his business.</i>

993
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:41,463
We're fucked, man.

994
01:20:50,806 --> 01:20:53,892
<i>But what better place
for a miracle to happen</i>

995
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:56,520
<i>than in the City of God?</i>

996
01:20:59,898 --> 01:21:01,984
Look who's here.
My sugar babe.

997
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:03,610
- Let me through.
- Gimme a kiss, girl.

998
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:08,574
Let me through, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

999
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:11,702
Come on, Li'l Zé.

1000
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:21,128
Hi, honey.

1001
01:21:21,837 --> 01:21:24,006
Everything OK, baby?

1002
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:34,892
<i>The problem was simple.</i>

1003
01:21:35,017 --> 01:21:36,518
<i>Li'l Zé was ugly.</i>

1004
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:40,856
<i>Knockout Ned was handsome.
He could get any girl.</i>

1005
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:44,610
<i>Li'l Zé had to pay or use force.</i>

1006
01:21:44,735 --> 01:21:49,197
<i>It was a duel
between the handsome good guy</i>

1007
01:21:49,323 --> 01:21:51,491
<i>and the ugly bad guy.</i>

1008
01:21:51,617 --> 01:21:53,118
Let me go!

1009
01:21:57,122 --> 01:21:59,124
Just enjoy it.

1010
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:01,251
Come on.

1011
01:22:01,376 --> 01:22:03,712
You're mine now.

1012
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:07,841
I told you'd be mine.

1013
01:22:10,761 --> 01:22:14,056
Hey, faggot, your broad's really hot!

1014
01:22:46,505 --> 01:22:48,840
I can't even look her in the face now.

1015
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:53,303
I can't.

1016
01:22:58,976 --> 01:23:02,312
Why didn't that fucker kill me?

1017
01:23:06,525 --> 01:23:08,026
Hold on.

1018
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,988
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

1019
01:23:11,113 --> 01:23:12,781
Let's go back.

1020
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:15,701
- What about Carrot?
- Let's go back.

1021
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:17,327
You gonna kill him?

1022
01:23:21,415 --> 01:23:25,377
Knockout Ned, motherfucker!
Come out, you loser!

1023
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:28,755
Take it easy.

1024
01:23:30,882 --> 01:23:32,342
I'm going out.

1025
01:23:32,467 --> 01:23:34,469
Let me go.

1026
01:23:47,482 --> 01:23:50,569
- Gerson!
- Come back, son!

1027
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:04,958
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.

1028
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:08,503
Let's talk. We can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.

1029
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:12,090
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

1030
01:24:12,215 --> 01:24:13,425
He hasn't done anything.

1031
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:17,429
Are you crazy?
You know who I am?

1032
01:24:17,554 --> 01:24:20,557
- Li'l Zé, man.
- He's Li'l Zé.

1033
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:24,352
Call that motherfucker!

1034
01:24:28,857 --> 01:24:31,151
Go on, man.

1035
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:33,737
Calm down. I'll call him.

1036
01:25:07,938 --> 01:25:11,233
I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

1037
01:25:11,358 --> 01:25:14,069
That loser got what he deserved.

1038
01:25:14,194 --> 01:25:16,029
Let's go!

1039
01:25:42,472 --> 01:25:43,974
Gerson.

1040
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:47,435
That bastard killed my brother.

1041
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:58,029
I can't let that go.

1042
01:26:07,706 --> 01:26:09,207
So?

1043
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,213
Want a gun?

1044
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:18,550
- My son.
- Calm down, Mum.

1045
01:26:19,968 --> 01:26:22,554
Please, Mum.

1046
01:26:31,646 --> 01:26:36,860
- Do it right, asshole.
- There's no other way.

1047
01:26:36,985 --> 01:26:39,571
How did I let that loser hit me?

1048
01:26:39,696 --> 01:26:42,949
Shit, it's deep.

1049
01:27:11,561 --> 01:27:14,898
- It's as if we were brothers.
- Shut up.

1050
01:27:15,023 --> 01:27:19,069
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

1051
01:27:19,194 --> 01:27:22,739
- Shut up!
- That was incredible!

1052
01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:25,575
- Shut up!
- That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?

1053
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:29,955
He came out of nowhere.

1054
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:34,167
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

1055
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:46,012
<i>It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.</i>

1056
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:48,265
God bless you, son.

1057
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:51,893
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

1058
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:56,731
Keep cool.

1059
01:27:58,149 --> 01:27:59,818
You did a good job.

1060
01:27:59,943 --> 01:28:02,362
You'd better go hide.

1061
01:28:04,656 --> 01:28:07,826
<i>I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.</i>

1062
01:28:07,951 --> 01:28:10,745
<i>But God had other plans.</i>

1063
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:14,666
Steak, where are all the dealers?

1064
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:18,128
They're hiding.
Li'l Zé is in a bad mood.

1065
01:28:18,253 --> 01:28:22,048
They get us hooked
and then they go off and hide.

1066
01:28:22,173 --> 01:28:25,176
Do me a favour.
Go get some nose candy for me.

1067
01:28:25,677 --> 01:28:27,012
I'll try.

1068
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:31,141
Tell them it's for Tiago,
to keep my buzz going.

1069
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:53,580
Steak'n'fries,

1070
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:57,042
go to Carrot's and tell him.

1071
01:28:57,167 --> 01:28:59,878
Li'l Zé says
that if you kill Knockout,

1072
01:29:00,003 --> 01:29:01,880
he'll leave you alone.

1073
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:05,884
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

1074
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:08,511
Grab the kid!

1075
01:29:11,014 --> 01:29:12,515
You heard the boy?

1076
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:16,644
If you don't stick with us,
you're dead.

1077
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,648
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

1078
01:29:20,774 --> 01:29:23,693
Drugs aren't my thing.

1079
01:29:23,818 --> 01:29:25,987
This is just something
between me and him.

1080
01:29:27,864 --> 01:29:30,867
Those guys aren't worth shit.

1081
01:29:30,992 --> 01:29:34,496
They'll do anything for power.

1082
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:35,622
Got the kid.

1083
01:29:35,747 --> 01:29:41,461
Like that kid.
They're all robots, like this punk here.

1084
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:42,921
What's in your head, kid?

1085
01:29:44,297 --> 01:29:46,800
Can't you see
you're wrecking your life

1086
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:51,096
with that maniac
and a bunch of trigger-happy fools?

1087
01:29:52,597 --> 01:29:55,350
Are you crazy?

1088
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:57,519
- You're just a kid.
- A kid?

1089
01:29:57,644 --> 01:30:02,690
I smoke, snort,
I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.

1090
01:30:02,816 --> 01:30:05,485
Shit, you have no idea!

1091
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,613
You should join up with us.

1092
01:30:08,738 --> 01:30:09,906
Shall we kill him?

1093
01:30:10,031 --> 01:30:14,160
Steak, we're going to grind you.

1094
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:19,791
- OK, I accept.
- Great!

1095
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:24,087
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are in command.

1096
01:30:24,212 --> 01:30:25,630
But on one condition.

1097
01:30:26,673 --> 01:30:30,343
No killing of innocent people.

1098
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:34,764
I can't accept that, understand?

1099
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:37,517
OK, no innocent people.

1100
01:30:37,642 --> 01:30:40,603
No innocent people.

1101
01:30:40,728 --> 01:30:43,148
Steak fucked up!

1102
01:30:47,986 --> 01:30:49,863
Cool it, little shit!

1103
01:30:57,454 --> 01:30:58,872
Have you got a gun for me?

1104
01:30:58,997 --> 01:31:03,460
No, but we can hold up a gun store.

1105
01:31:03,585 --> 01:31:05,753
No problem.

1106
01:31:05,879 --> 01:31:09,841
I don't want to hold up anything.
I'm not a hoodlum.

1107
01:31:09,966 --> 01:31:13,386
This is a personal affair
between me and him, OK?

1108
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:16,347
I'm not a hoodlum.

1109
01:31:18,558 --> 01:31:20,560
He raped your chick,

1110
01:31:20,685 --> 01:31:24,522
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house,

1111
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:27,650
and you killed one of his guys.

1112
01:31:32,614 --> 01:31:36,367
If you're not a hood, then get out.

1113
01:31:46,753 --> 01:31:48,505
- It's a hold-up!
- This is a hold-up!

1114
01:31:57,597 --> 01:31:59,140
<i>The first time...</i>

1115
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:01,017
Where are the revolvers?

1116
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:04,979
<i>...Knockout Ned saved a sales
assistant from being shot by Carrot.</i>

1117
01:32:05,104 --> 01:32:09,526
We said no killing!

1118
01:32:09,651 --> 01:32:11,152
That's the rule.

1119
01:32:12,862 --> 01:32:17,283
We want the boss's money.
Everyone keep calm.

1120
01:32:17,408 --> 01:32:21,287
You want us to go? We do too.

1121
01:32:21,412 --> 01:32:24,916
Come on, give me the money!

1122
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:26,042
Look at the ground!

1123
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:29,170
<i>The second time,
Carrot saved Knockout Ned's life.</i>

1124
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:35,426
<i>Ned learned that
there's an exception to every rule.</i>

1125
01:32:35,552 --> 01:32:37,554
Exception to the rule.

1126
01:32:40,098 --> 01:32:41,683
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

1127
01:32:41,808 --> 01:32:45,895
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1128
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,397
On the ground!

1129
01:32:49,941 --> 01:32:51,526
Give me the money!

1130
01:32:55,488 --> 01:32:57,699
I'm not kidding.

1131
01:32:57,824 --> 01:33:00,159
The first person
who moves is dead!

1132
01:33:00,285 --> 01:33:04,205
<i>The third time,
the exception becomes the rule.</i>

1133
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:21,431
<i>With the hold-up money,</i>

1134
01:33:21,556 --> 01:33:24,475
<i>Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li'l Zé.</i>

1135
01:33:24,601 --> 01:33:27,562
<i>Carrot could protect his business.</i>

1136
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:29,397
<i>Knockout Ned,</i>

1137
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:32,525
<i>the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.</i>

1138
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:36,946
First, the Italians. This is a 9mm.

1139
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:39,824
- Let me see.
- Not bad, eh?

1140
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:41,534
The sight isn't well-aligned.

1141
01:33:41,659 --> 01:33:44,829
I'll give you a good price.

1142
01:33:44,954 --> 01:33:48,333
The 12mm. The "hand job".

1143
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:49,500
See why?

1144
01:33:49,626 --> 01:33:52,754
An Uzi, 9mm. It's Israeli.

1145
01:33:52,879 --> 01:33:54,631
The Star of David.

1146
01:33:54,756 --> 01:33:57,383
- Jewish.
- I want a 30-06.

1147
01:33:58,259 --> 01:34:01,387
Now we can start having fun.

1148
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:04,849
The war's on.
Let's start with a prayer.

1149
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:09,520
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1150
01:34:09,646 --> 01:34:11,856
Thy kingdom come.

1151
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:16,569
Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven.

1152
01:34:16,694 --> 01:34:19,072
Give us this day our daily bread.

1153
01:34:19,197 --> 01:34:21,032
And forgive us our trespasses,

1154
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:24,410
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1155
01:34:24,535 --> 01:34:26,621
And lead us not into temptation,

1156
01:34:26,746 --> 01:34:28,873
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

1157
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:31,959
<i>Hoodlums have guns, but can't shoot.</i>

1158
01:34:32,085 --> 01:34:36,297
<i>One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li'l Zé's gang.</i>

1159
01:34:36,422 --> 01:34:40,635
<i>Li'l Zé couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.</i>

1160
01:34:43,221 --> 01:34:47,517
<i>The slum had been purgatory.
Now it was hell.</i>

1161
01:34:51,562 --> 01:34:53,731
<i>I decided to get out.</i>

1162
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:56,943
<i>That's how I became a reporter.</i>

1163
01:34:58,069 --> 01:35:02,573
Great photo!
I bet it's by Rogerio Reis.

1164
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,536
What did I tell you?

1165
01:35:06,661 --> 01:35:08,329
<i>Like any pro,</i>

1166
01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:12,709
<i>I started at the bottom.
Way down at the bottom.</i>

1167
01:35:12,834 --> 01:35:16,337
<i>Without knowing what awaited me.</i>

1168
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:20,925
<i>Instead of going home,
I'd go over to the paper.</i>

1169
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:24,721
<i>A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.</i>

1170
01:35:24,846 --> 01:35:27,432
Check this out.

1171
01:35:27,557 --> 01:35:31,561
<i>He helped me move closer
to what I loved most In life.</i>

1172
01:35:31,686 --> 01:35:33,688
- Hi, Rogerio.
- How are you, Pierre?

1173
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:36,441
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.

1174
01:35:36,566 --> 01:35:37,984
Hello, Rocket.

1175
01:35:38,109 --> 01:35:39,652
- He's a fan of yours.
- Really?

1176
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:42,029
You have good taste, Rocket!

1177
01:35:42,155 --> 01:35:45,408
- Well, I'm done. I'm off.
- See you.

1178
01:35:45,533 --> 01:35:48,286
What a cool guy!

1179
01:35:49,078 --> 01:35:52,165
<i>What should have been
a swift revenge</i>

1180
01:35:52,290 --> 01:35:54,709
<i>turned into an all-out war.</i>

1181
01:36:00,006 --> 01:36:02,341
<i>The City of God was divided.</i>

1182
01:36:02,467 --> 01:36:06,304
<i>You couldn't go
from one section to the other.</i>

1183
01:36:06,429 --> 01:36:08,181
<i>Not even to visit a relative.</i>

1184
01:36:08,306 --> 01:36:12,727
<i>The cops considered anyone
living in the slum a hoodlum.</i>

1185
01:36:12,852 --> 01:36:16,272
<i>People got used to living in Vietnam.</i>

1186
01:36:20,568 --> 01:36:25,656
<i>And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.</i>

1187
01:36:25,782 --> 01:36:27,617
- This kid...
- What do you want?

1188
01:36:27,742 --> 01:36:29,911
A boy from Carrot's gang punched me.

1189
01:36:30,036 --> 01:36:31,954
<i>The war
was an excuse for everything.</i>

1190
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:33,831
Li'l Zé's soldiers kicked my ass.

1191
01:36:33,956 --> 01:36:37,877
Take this.22.

1192
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:42,173
The jerk who raped my sister
is with Carrot.

1193
01:36:42,298 --> 01:36:43,758
Li'l Zé evicted my family.

1194
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:45,176
I'm unemployed...

1195
01:36:45,301 --> 01:36:46,427
Kill... Be respected.

1196
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:48,846
A guy from Li'l Zé's gang
is messing up with my sister.

1197
01:36:58,815 --> 01:37:01,567
I'm Tiago, a friend of Benny's.

1198
01:37:01,692 --> 01:37:04,362
- Can you read? Can you add?
- Yes.

1199
01:37:04,487 --> 01:37:07,907
I'm pretty good in business.

1200
01:37:08,032 --> 01:37:09,909
OK, get to work.

1201
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:13,788
- What do you want?
- To get my father's murderer.

1202
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:16,958
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.

1203
01:37:22,421 --> 01:37:24,465
What's the matter?

1204
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:28,553
- He's a worker.
- But he wants a gun.

1205
01:37:29,345 --> 01:37:32,014
He won't last a week.

1206

<i>A year later, no-one remembered

1211
01:38:51,010 --> 01:38:53,054
<i>The media started taking an interest.</i>

1212
01:38:53,179 --> 01:38:56,432
<i>The police had to intervene.</i>

1213
01:39:10,029 --> 01:39:14,617
<i>A gang leader from the City of God

<i>Is the war still going on?</i>

<i>It's still going on.</i>

1219

<i>Have many people died?</i>

1220
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:31,425
<i>Many have died.</i>

1221
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,552
<i>Mostly innocent people.</i>

1222
01:39:33,678 --> 01:39:37,431
<i>Just knowing me</i>

1223
01:39:37,556 --> 01:39:41,644

<i>The police don't go in there?</i>

<i>They go after me, not him.</i>

<i>Knockout Ned says

<i>Police Chief Guedes</i>

1231
01:40:11,424 --> 01:40:13,259
Motherfucker!

01:40:13,384 --> 01:40:17,096
I'm the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1233

- Just Knockout Ned's.

1234

Keep looking.

1235
01:40:22,476 --> 01:40:25,146
At least my name's got to be in there.

Nothing.

1239
01:40:32,737 --> 01:40:36,615
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1240
01:40:36,741 --> 01:40:38,242
It's just the want ads.

1241
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:41,620
I don't care! Read everything!

1242

But there aren't any articles.

1243

Want a bullet in your head?

1244
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,630
Gotta show them who's boss here.

<i>- Give me the camera!

01:41:16,113 --> 01:41:18,699
Back off.

1252
01:41:18,824 --> 01:41:20,034
There's no click.

1253
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:23,621
What a bunch of bozos!

1254
01:41:23,746 --> 01:41:26,791
I'm fucked off with you guys.

1255
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:28,250
I have an idea.

1256
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:33,130
I'll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1257
01:41:36,759 --> 01:41:38,177
Here he is.

1258
01:41:38,302 --> 01:41:41,138
Take the camera.

1259
01:41:41,263 --> 01:41:43,724
Well, kid?

1260
01:41:44,934 --> 01:41:47,144
Aren't you a photographer?

1261
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:50,189
Make the camera work.
We can't do it.

1262
01:41:52,066 --> 01:41:53,818
Take our picture.

1263
01:41:59,156 --> 01:42:02,535
- You fucking broke it.
- It wasn't me.

1264
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,829
I think the problem is here.

1265
01:42:13,796 --> 01:42:16,257
- What's your name?
- Rocket.

1266
01:42:16,382 --> 01:42:18,926
Another picture, Rocket.

1267
01:42:19,051 --> 01:42:21,846
- How about two rows?
- What?

1268
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:25,766
Two rows.
Everyone with their guns.

1269
01:42:26,517 --> 01:42:28,769
You're outside, for Christ's sake!

1270
01:42:28,894 --> 01:42:32,606
- Talk to him nicely, kid.
- Sorry. Move in, please.

1271
01:42:34,942 --> 01:42:37,570
Another one.

1272
01:42:41,574 --> 01:42:44,243
- I think the roll's finished.
- Show us the pictures.

1273
01:42:44,368 --> 01:42:48,247
- They have to be developed.
- Developed?

1274
01:42:48,372 --> 01:42:49,456
How much is it?

1275
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:55,379
Take this money
and bring back the pictures.

1276
01:42:55,504 --> 01:43:00,718
- I have to remove the film.
- Keep the camera.

1277
01:43:00,843 --> 01:43:05,723
Benny wanted to give it to you.
It's yours.

1278
01:43:05,848 --> 01:43:07,349
Thanks.

1279
01:43:09,435 --> 01:43:11,437
Don't forget the pictures.

1280
01:43:11,562 --> 01:43:14,690
The photos, Rocket!

1281
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:27,203
- Pierre!
- What?

1282
01:43:27,745 --> 01:43:30,414
Can you develop this for me?

1283
01:43:31,832 --> 01:43:35,127
I can't, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1284
01:43:35,252 --> 01:43:39,215
It's only for the paper's reporters.
I could risk my job.

1285
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:41,717
Develop these for me.

1286
01:43:41,842 --> 01:43:44,887
This one too, OK?

1287
01:43:45,012 --> 01:43:47,389
I'm going to lunch.

1288
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:52,519
- You're lucky. What size?
- What?

1289
01:43:52,645 --> 01:43:55,606
For the enlargement, what size?

1290
01:43:55,731 --> 01:43:59,568
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1291
01:44:19,338 --> 01:44:21,423
- Here.
- Thanks.

1292
01:44:23,676 --> 01:44:24,885
Let's go.

1293
01:44:25,386 --> 01:44:26,804
I'm in deep shit now.

1294
01:44:29,974 --> 01:44:31,976
I'm as good as dead.

1295
01:44:43,779 --> 01:44:45,864
<i>Someone had signed
my death sentence.</i>

1296
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:49,451
<i>I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.</i>

1297
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,710
Are you Marina?

1298
01:44:57,835 --> 01:45:01,130
Because of you, I'm dead.
You stole my photos.

1299
01:45:01,255 --> 01:45:03,299
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?

1300
01:45:03,424 --> 01:45:05,301
Not so loud.

1301
01:45:05,426 --> 01:45:08,721
Not so loud?
I'll be killed because of you.

1302
01:45:08,846 --> 01:45:11,807
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1303
01:45:11,932 --> 01:45:14,226
There's nothing I can do.

1304
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:17,855
The photos in our lab are photos
to be published in the paper.

1305
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:21,317
I saw the photos, I published them.

1306
01:45:21,442 --> 01:45:23,652
- You stole them.
- I did not. Here.

1307
01:45:23,777 --> 01:45:28,907
- Give them to me.
- Just a second.

1308
01:45:29,992 --> 01:45:31,827
Give them back to me.

1309
01:45:31,952 --> 01:45:33,078
Are there any others?

1310
01:45:33,203 --> 01:45:35,789
Calm down. What's your name?

1311
01:45:36,373 --> 01:45:39,293
- Rocket.
- Rocket?

1312
01:45:40,169 --> 01:45:42,629
Nice to meet you. I'm Marina.

1313
01:45:42,755 --> 01:45:48,093
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1314
01:45:48,218 --> 01:45:53,891
Here, when we use a picture,
we pay the photographer.

1315
01:45:54,016 --> 01:45:56,769
- Do you want to be a photographer?
- Yes.

1316
01:45:56,894 --> 01:45:58,854
Great start! On the front page.

1317
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:02,608
- How did you get these photos?
- I live there.

1318
01:46:02,733 --> 01:46:07,237
Rocket, no photographer
has ever been able to go in there.

1319
01:46:08,489 --> 01:46:13,160
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li'l Zé,

1320
01:46:13,285 --> 01:46:15,579
the paper would buy them.

1321
01:46:15,704 --> 01:46:18,415
We'd pay you.

1322
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:20,709
Could you?

1323
01:46:20,834 --> 01:46:22,753
I don't know.

1324
01:46:22,878 --> 01:46:24,463
What's the problem?

1325
01:46:24,588 --> 01:46:27,591
The problem?
I can't go there any more at night.

1326
01:46:27,716 --> 01:46:29,551
And during the day?

1327
01:46:29,676 --> 01:46:30,928
It's too risky.

1328
01:46:33,555 --> 01:46:38,602
Look, man! They've finally
understood that I'm the boss.

1329
01:46:40,771 --> 01:46:42,606
What's your
photographer-friend's name?

1330
01:46:42,731 --> 01:46:44,233
Rocket.

1331
01:46:44,358 --> 01:46:47,319
He's good.
I'll take more to show the others.

1332
01:46:50,322 --> 01:46:54,201
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1333
01:46:56,203 --> 01:46:59,206
It's a great opportunity.

1334
01:47:01,542 --> 01:47:03,544
OK.

1335
01:47:03,669 --> 01:47:06,797
You made the right choice.
Very good!

1336
01:47:06,922 --> 01:47:09,425
I'll give you some film, lenses,
and another camera.

1337
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:14,096
I'll show you the equipment room.

1338
01:47:15,389 --> 01:47:17,724
There's another problem.

1339
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:20,811
- What is it?
- Where can I sleep tonight?

1340
01:47:21,687 --> 01:47:24,106
I can't go back now.

1341
01:47:27,067 --> 01:47:29,403
This is a 135mm.

1342
01:47:29,528 --> 01:47:32,781
- Will you be close up or far away?
- Far away.

1343
01:47:32,906 --> 01:47:34,408
- Can you measure the light?
- Yes.

1344
01:47:34,533 --> 01:47:36,577
Try it.

1345
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:41,707
Aren't you too close?

1346
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,920
<i>I don't know what made me
go talk to them like that.</i>

1347
01:47:47,045 --> 01:47:49,298
<i>Maybe I was going to die,</i>

1348
01:47:49,423 --> 01:47:52,843
<i>but now I had a camera</i>

1349
01:47:52,968 --> 01:47:56,054
<i>and a chance
to become a photographer.</i>

1350
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:58,932
Watch out for the dog shit.

1351
01:47:59,057 --> 01:48:03,228
<i>Not to mention
that the night was still young.</i>

1352
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:06,064
- Want something to eat?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

1353
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:09,651
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?

1354
01:48:09,776 --> 01:48:12,196
A joint?

1355
01:48:13,113 --> 01:48:14,865
Try this.

1356
01:48:33,592 --> 01:48:35,594
It's time to go to sleep.

1357
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:41,099
I'll show you your bed.

1358
01:48:41,225 --> 01:48:47,105
- The water is hot, isn't it?
- Yes. You've never taken a hot shower?

1359
01:48:47,231 --> 01:48:49,525
- No.
- What do you do?

1360
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:53,070
We heat up the kettle.

1361
01:48:53,195 --> 01:48:56,782
- Why are you standing there?
- What room do I sleep in?

1362
01:48:56,907 --> 01:49:03,372
Unfortunately, there's only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

1363
01:49:03,497 --> 01:49:07,251
<i>I won't go into the details
of my first sexual experience.</i>

1364
01:49:07,376 --> 01:49:09,378
Just relax.

1365
01:49:11,046 --> 01:49:12,965
<i>Because elsewhere</i>

1366
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:19,096
<i>another more important sex scene
for the slum was taking place.</i>

1367
01:49:19,221 --> 01:49:24,142
<i>Carrot was helping Knockout Ned escape
without firing a shot.</i>

1368
01:49:25,769 --> 01:49:31,608
<i>The policeman guarding him
was in the willing hands of the nurse.</i>

1369
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:37,114
<i>And in the meantime, to eliminate Carrot,
Li'l Zé was investing in munitions.</i>

1370
01:49:37,239 --> 01:49:40,450
<i>He invested heavily,
even if he couldn't pay.</i>

1371
01:49:41,451 --> 01:49:44,621
- Remember the double-barrel?
- I already have it.

1372
01:49:44,746 --> 01:49:46,331
This is a repeater rifle.

1373
01:49:46,456 --> 01:49:50,961
You don't have this one, the Browning.
It'll shoot down a plane.

1374
01:49:51,086 --> 01:49:54,256
I'm not shooting down planes.
And the one I asked for?

1375
01:49:54,381 --> 01:49:56,675
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1376
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:02,514
- You can't get them in Brazil.
- Uncle Sam, my ass.

1377
01:50:05,183 --> 01:50:07,477
I have a solution.

1378
01:50:07,603 --> 01:50:09,605
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1379
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:14,318
It's like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1380
01:50:14,443 --> 01:50:17,738
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1381
01:50:17,863 --> 01:50:20,949
- It depends.
- It depends, my ass!

1382
01:50:21,074 --> 01:50:23,744
Trying to fuck me over?

1383
01:50:23,869 --> 01:50:25,370
I'll fuck you over first.

1384
01:50:25,495 --> 01:50:29,041
You leave now
without the money or the guns.

1385
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:31,043
What do I tell the boss?

1386
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:35,005
That's your problem.
You'll think of something.

1387
01:50:35,130 --> 01:50:37,174
You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1388
01:50:37,299 --> 01:50:40,886
Beat it, fatso.

1389
01:50:41,011 --> 01:50:42,596
<i>Li'l Zé had made a big mistake.</i>

1390
01:50:42,721 --> 01:50:46,975
<i>He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.</i>

1391
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,603
<i>And they don't joke around.</i>

1392
01:50:51,021 --> 01:50:53,023
Have you seen this?

1393
01:50:53,857 --> 01:50:56,360
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1394
01:50:56,485 --> 01:50:58,445
These stories
will push the police to investigate.

1395
01:50:58,570 --> 01:51:02,074
They'll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1396
01:51:02,199 --> 01:51:06,620
Think I'm going to give you away?

1397
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:15,045
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
But don't fuck up again.

1398
01:51:21,885 --> 01:51:23,720
Charlie!

1399
01:51:24,638 --> 01:51:26,139
Come here!

1400
01:51:26,765 --> 01:51:30,769
Listen, you tell him.

1401
01:51:31,895 --> 01:51:35,982
Let's go make
that sleazy little dealer pay up.

1402
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:49,913
Come here, kids!

1403
01:51:51,998 --> 01:51:54,793
- Do you like chicken?
- It depends.

1404
01:51:54,918 --> 01:51:59,089
We'll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1405
01:51:59,214 --> 01:52:02,676
I have a present for you.

1406
01:52:04,636 --> 01:52:06,430
Here.

1407
01:52:07,723 --> 01:52:10,142
A big one for you.

1408
01:52:10,267 --> 01:52:12,477
Are you really giving us these guns?

1409
01:52:12,602 --> 01:52:17,357
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1410
01:52:17,482 --> 01:52:19,651
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1411
01:52:19,776 --> 01:52:21,987
Not in the slum.

1412
01:52:22,112 --> 01:52:25,157
- Can you shoot?
- More or less.

1413
01:52:25,282 --> 01:52:30,287
Hey, you guys, come help these kids.

1414
01:52:32,247 --> 01:52:34,458
I know. You do it like this.

1415
01:52:51,433 --> 01:52:53,310
Get that chicken!

1416
01:53:05,697 --> 01:53:07,032
Come on, let's go.

1417
01:53:07,616 --> 01:53:09,326
If Li'l Zé catches you, he'll kill you.

1418
01:53:11,244 --> 01:53:14,206
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.

1419
01:53:21,671 --> 01:53:24,299
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1420
01:53:24,424 --> 01:53:27,219
Get that chicken!

1421
01:53:27,344 --> 01:53:29,387
Shit! The cops!

1422
01:53:29,513 --> 01:53:31,765
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1423
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:33,809
Give me that.

1424
01:53:44,903 --> 01:53:47,322
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

1425
01:53:47,447 --> 01:53:50,492
Get the hell out of here!

1426
01:53:50,617 --> 01:53:52,202
Coward!

1427
01:53:52,327 --> 01:53:54,329
Asshole!

1428
01:53:55,372 --> 01:53:58,375
Come on, let them kill each other.

1429
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,502
They can fuck themselves.

1430
01:54:09,386 --> 01:54:12,013
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1431
01:54:13,306 --> 01:54:15,725
What are you waiting for?

1432
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:38,331
What's happening?

1433
01:54:39,207 --> 01:54:40,207
Shit!

1434
01:54:53,763 --> 01:54:55,390
Let's go!

1435
01:55:02,981 --> 01:55:04,816
Run! Run!

1436
01:55:27,923 --> 01:55:30,550
Move, come on.
Move!

1437
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:32,260
Let's go!

1438
01:55:34,095 --> 01:55:36,806
Kill one of these faggots! Blast him!

1439
01:56:12,842 --> 01:56:15,053
Take it easy. Don't move.

1440
01:56:15,178 --> 01:56:17,305
It hurts, man.

1441
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:20,850
Easy does it, kid.

1442
01:56:20,976 --> 01:56:23,812
Why did you join this fucking war?

1443
01:56:23,937 --> 01:56:27,983
Knockout Ned!
Li'l Zé's been hit. Come on!

1444
01:56:28,108 --> 01:56:31,152
Wait here. Hold on.

1445
01:56:40,203 --> 01:56:43,373
<i>- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.</i>

1446
01:56:51,756 --> 01:56:55,301
<i>I want to get my father's murderer.</i>

1447
01:57:23,997 --> 01:57:26,583
Wait here. Hold on.

1448
01:58:06,414 --> 01:58:08,416
The fucking cops!

1449
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:11,795
On the ground!

1450
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,713
- Hands over your head.
- Don't move!

1451
01:58:13,838 --> 01:58:15,882
- Come on.
- Stand up!

1452
01:58:16,007 --> 01:58:17,467
Move!

1453
01:58:19,511 --> 01:58:21,930
- Let's go.
- Move!

1454
01:58:22,055 --> 01:58:27,769
- You're the one I want.
- You're finished, pal.

1455
01:58:27,894 --> 01:58:30,480
Handcuff him.

1456
01:58:47,413 --> 01:58:51,751
- Wait! Where are you going?
- I got something to clear up.

1457
01:59:22,991 --> 01:59:24,659
OK, lovebirds.

1458
01:59:24,784 --> 01:59:27,453
Come on, Li'l Zé,
let's go settle our scores.

1459
01:59:27,579 --> 01:59:28,997
Come on.

1460
01:59:29,122 --> 01:59:32,458
Not you.
You're a present for the media.

1461
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:14,375
- Does it come to 10,000?
- Almost. That's all I have.

1462
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:17,712
- That's all there was, chief.
- We searched everywhere.

1463
02:00:17,837 --> 02:00:19,839
Let him go.

1464
02:00:22,675 --> 02:00:27,847
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1465
02:00:27,972 --> 02:00:32,602
Fill it up.
You'll owe us the rest.

1466
02:00:32,727 --> 02:00:34,562
Let's go.

1467
02:00:37,607 --> 02:00:40,068
Fucking war!

1468
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:44,614
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1469
02:00:44,739 --> 02:00:47,116
You're fucked, eh?

1470
02:00:47,242 --> 02:00:52,664
Kids, we'll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1471
02:00:52,789 --> 02:00:56,251
- Your business, Li'l Zé?
- What's your problem, kid?

1472
02:00:56,376 --> 02:00:58,962
This is for our friend, motherfucker!

1473
02:00:59,087 --> 02:01:00,588
A Soviet attack!

1474
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:09,847
The business is ours!

1475
02:02:04,444 --> 02:02:08,948
<i>This picture of the hood
will guarantee my salary.</i>

1476
02:02:11,159 --> 02:02:12,910
<i>This one will make me famous.</i>

1477
02:02:13,036 --> 02:02:14,787
<i>It'll even make the cover
of a magazine.</i>

1478
02:02:18,207 --> 02:02:20,126
<i>I won't have to worry
about Li'l Zé any more.</i>

1479
02:02:23,713 --> 02:02:25,715
<i>But the cops?</i>

1480
02:02:33,973 --> 02:02:39,020
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED BOSS
OF CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD

1481
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,523
Where are the other photos?

1482
02:02:42,648 --> 02:02:45,318
Only this photo
could've gotten us killed?

1483
02:02:45,443 --> 02:02:47,028
I think so.

1484
02:02:47,153 --> 02:02:51,699
- At least it got you a job.
- Not a job, an internship.

1485
02:02:51,824 --> 02:02:56,829
- It pays a little, doesn't it?
- A little.

1486
02:02:56,954 --> 02:02:59,874
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1487
02:02:59,999 --> 02:03:02,585
- More or less.
- You didn't like it?

1488
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:06,047
I don't think journalists
know how to screw.

1489
02:03:06,172 --> 02:03:10,718
- Cocoa robbed three houses in Barra.
- Better kill him.

1490
02:03:10,843 --> 02:03:13,262
- Who shot Roger?
- It was Beef.

1491
02:03:13,388 --> 02:03:15,223
Kill that fucker.

1492
02:03:15,348 --> 02:03:17,767
We should kill the chief
and Gringo as well.

1493
02:03:17,892 --> 02:03:21,396
- What about Cherry?
- Let's go. Us two, and three others.

1494
02:03:21,521 --> 02:03:23,356
It's a deal.

1495
02:03:23,481 --> 02:03:26,442
Have you heard of the Red Brigade?

1496
02:03:26,567 --> 02:03:29,278
No, but if they come,
we'll kill them.

1497
02:03:31,239 --> 02:03:34,325
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, sort of.

1498
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:37,537
Let's make a blacklist.
We'll kill them all.

1499
02:03:37,662 --> 02:03:40,998
- Put fucking Nightowl on there.
- And Croquet.

1500
02:03:41,124 --> 02:03:43,251
Leonard, too.
He owes me money.

1501
02:03:43,376 --> 02:03:45,420
And Chinaman.
He thinks he's hot stuff.

1502
02:03:45,545 --> 02:03:46,963
And Claudio.

1503
02:03:47,088 --> 02:03:50,508
- Where's Giant?
- Come on, Giant!

1504
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:09,694
<i>I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket any more.</i>

1505
02:04:09,819 --> 02:04:13,823
<i>I'm now Wilson Rodrigues,
photographer.</i>

1506
02:04:34,927 --> 02:04:36,929
<i>Manuel Machado, aka Knockout Ned,</i>

1507
02:04:37,054 --> 02:04:40,099
<i>was hospitalised after
being wounded by Li'l Zé's gang.</i>

1508
02:04:40,224 --> 02:04:43,311
<i>On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.</i>

1509
02:04:43,436 --> 02:04:48,608
<i>Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.</i>

1510
02:04:48,733 --> 02:04:52,361
<i>Just knowing me is enough,
just being my friend.</i>

1511
02:04:52,487 --> 02:04:58,409
<i>If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them.</i>

1512
02:04:58,534 --> 02:04:59,869
<i>The police don't go in there?</i>

1513
02:04:59,994 --> 02:05:06,209
<i>They go after me, not him.</i>

1514
02:05:06,334 --> 02:05:09,962
<i>I've been in jail three times,</i>

1515
02:05:10,087 --> 02:05:13,341
<i>while he goes on
killing undisturbed.</i>

1516
02:05:13,466 --> 02:05:17,386
<i>And they don't arrest him.</i>

1517
02:05:17,512 --> 02:05:19,972
<i>Knockout Ned
says the war will continue.</i>

1518

<i>Police Chief Jose Guedes</i>

1519
02:05:22,183 --> 02:05:25,353
<i>has promised to arrest
both gangs in the City of God.</i>
