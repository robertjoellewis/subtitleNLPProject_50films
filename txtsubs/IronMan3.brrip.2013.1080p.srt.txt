<font face="Comic Sans MS">A famous man once said,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We create our own demons."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said that?
What does that even mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now, he was famous</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to start again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's track this from the beginning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half hour till the ball drops.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave a speech? How was it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are we going?
- To town, on each other.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably back in your room</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I also want
to see your research.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you can see my research,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ho Yinsen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I finally met a man called "Ho."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to introduce you
to our guest, Dr. Wu.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, this guy.
- Mr. Stark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a heart doctor. She's going to
need a cardiologist after I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps another time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It started in Bern, Switzerland.
1999.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The old days.
- Mr. Stark!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought they would
come back to bite me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would they?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Hey, Tony!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, but Ms. Hansen,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we're full.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, he made it. He made the cut.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What floor you going to, pal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ground floor, actually,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Advanced Idea Mechanics,"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see that,
because it's on your T-shirt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, I'll call you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you up
on the roof in 5 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I'm talking about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you up there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn betcha.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it was.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- that governs repair...
- Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and chemically recode it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...operating system...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...
Can you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy...
- That's cute...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave her ficus alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because.
And, no, seriously, don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And you're starting with plants.
- For now, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm calling it EXTREMIS.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, it's...
- Human application.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly, exactly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...even limb regrowth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In Switzerland.
- That's better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're seeing things.
- This week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You almost bought it, didn't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The what?
- Down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down! Stay down, boss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're good.
- Stay down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right on me. I made it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not Y2K.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Happy New Year!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You good?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why am I telling you this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I had just created demons</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I didn't even know it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, those were good times.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I moved on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot that night in Switzerland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- These days, I'm a changed man.
- 46.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm different now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... Well...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 47.
- You know who I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. 48.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you wish, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which I will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's do this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DUM-E.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, DUM-E.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood on my mat. Handle it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Focus up, ladies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start tight and then go wide.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stamp date and time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lnitialise sequence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, drop my needle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crap.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow it down just a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...little bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool it, will you, Jarvis?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. I ain't scared of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the best.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't think it could get any worse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I had to go and turn on the TV.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when he happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some people call me a terrorist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I consider myself a teacher.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready for another lesson?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and claim their land.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39 hours ago,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I... I did that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A quaint military church</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">filled with wives and children,
of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The braves were away.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">President Ellis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you've missed me again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know who I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know where I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll never see me coming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that we seem to be back,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">American airwaves were hijacked...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nation remains on high alert.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a newly minted resource.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The American people
will soon know him</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as the Iron Patriot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how is President Ellis responding?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By taking the guy
they call War Machine</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and giving him a paint job.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "lron Patriot."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tested well with focus groups,
all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"War Machine" was
a little too aggressive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
This sends a better message.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, can we talk about this guy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's classified information, Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, there have been 9 bombings.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 9.
- The public only knows about 3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no bomb casings.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I can help. Just ask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Einstein slept 3 hours a year.
Look what he did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to come at me like that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not trying to be a dick...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...tator.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind signing my drawing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Richard doesn't mind.
Are you all right with this, Dick?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Fine with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's your name?
- Erin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, the Pentagon is scared.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After New York, aliens... Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need to look strong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I get it.
- It's American business.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I said I got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I broke the crayon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay, Mr. Stark?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy. Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get out of the Wormhole?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. Tony!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you say?
- Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just checking on the suit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check the heart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the brain?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so I was poisoned?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I gotta split.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Badge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Badge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, badge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an asset that we can put to use.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should start
phasing it out immediately.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am thrilled that you are now
the Head Of Security. Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- However...
- I do appreciate it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a compliment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not...
It is a compliment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Potts, your 4:00 is here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy, we'll talk about this later,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How so?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it's a little awkward.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like the sound of that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killian?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look really great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you look great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I... I.-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What on earth have you been doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing fancy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just 5 years in the hands
of physical therapists.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And please, call me Aldrich.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to be
issued a security badge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very nice to see you, Killian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guy-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merry Christmas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" biotech research,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my think tank</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now has a little something
in the pipeline.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna turn your lights down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regard the human brain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold on, hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's...
That's the universe. My bad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if I do that...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the brain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, that's amazing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, it's mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This. You're inside my head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a...
It's a live feed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on up, I'll prove it to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, pinch my arm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take it. Pinch me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is what I wanted to show you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it goes here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that our mind,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our entire DNA, in fact,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is destined to be upgraded.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this Forehead Of Security?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, harassing interns?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They would laugh in my face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? Fill me in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- For real?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
She's meeting up with this scientist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where were we in '99?
The science conference?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you don't remember him.
He's not a blond with a big rack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now it's getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- His what?
- Big brain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. See?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at what? You, watching them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
I don't work for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's shifty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Relax.
- Seriously?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're just ignoring her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A giant brain?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you, Happy-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you're off with the super-friends.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what's going on
with you any more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate to cut you off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should probably go over there
and zap her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and recode its DNA.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be incredible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, Tony-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He turned me down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But something tells me,
now there's a new genius on the throne</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who doesn't have to
answer to Tony anymore</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and who has slightly less of an ego.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As much as I'd like to help you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then, as my father used to say,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's very deep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have no idea what it means.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Car's ready, if you're ready to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I just...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I forgot my other things, so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I'm late. I was...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...
What is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wearing this in the house now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that, like, Mark 15?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breaking it in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag at first, so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did. I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it gonna fit through the door?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, actually, it's a good question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- So...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tense? Good day? Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I like it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I appreciate the thought very much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. Damn it, no can do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to just kiss it
on the... The facial slit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, why don't I
run down to the garage</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and see if I can't find a crowbar
to Jimmy that thing open?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crowbar, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except there's been a radiation leak.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least, let me get you, like,
a hazmat suit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Geiger counter or something like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Busted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ate without me already?
On date night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He was just...
- You mean you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah, I just mean
we were hosting you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...while I finished up a little work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yes, I had a quick bite.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know if you were coming home</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy was concerned.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're spying on me.
- I wasn't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Pep?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I admit it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My fault. Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a piping hot mess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing's been the same
since New York.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? I didn't notice that at all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You experience things</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only reason I haven't cracked up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is probably because you moved in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you. I'm lucky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But honey, I can't sleep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tinker. I....</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Threat is imminent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my suits, they're...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Machines.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're part of me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A distraction.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take a shower.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're gonna join me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony. Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must have called it in my sleep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not supposed to happen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll recalibrate the sensors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we just... Just let me...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to sleep downstairs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tinker with that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you regulate?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can regulate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You sure about that?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a decent batch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, for understanding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing, buddy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You out by yourself?
A little date night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seeing your favourite
chick flick, maybe?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a little movie
called The Party's Over,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">starring you and your junkie girlfriend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the ticket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Savin!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">True story about fortune cookies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look Chinese.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They sound Chinese.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they're actually
an American invention.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is why they're hollow,
full of lies</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and leave a bad taste in the mouth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My disciples just destroyed another
cheap American knockoff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Chinese Theatre.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this must be getting frustrating.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this season of terror
is drawing to a close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't worry, the big one is coming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your graduation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind leaving that on?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a stickler for that sort of thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His reaction
to the latest attack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, hi there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else you can tell us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mr. Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you want?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's a little holiday greeting</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're a coward.
So I've decided</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you just died, pal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna come get the body.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10880 Malibu Point.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">90265.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll leave the door unlocked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you wanted, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">drawn from
S.H.l.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. What have we got here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "adviser to the king."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">South American insurgency tactics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talks like a Baptist preacher.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No bomb parts found in a 3-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to me, Happy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When is a bomb not a bomb?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any military victims?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not according to public record, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring up
the thermogenic signatures again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Factor in 3,000 degrees.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Accessing satellites</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That.
Are you sure that's not one of his?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It predates any known Mandarin attack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring her around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The heat signature
is remarkably similar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3,000 degree Celsius.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's 2 military guys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we still at ding-dong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're supposed to be on total...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...security lockdown.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only so much I can do, sir,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you give the world's press
your home address.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right there is fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the Mandarin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you? Are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why am I not surprised?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gluten-free waffles, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's urgent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- With her.
- Tony?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Old botanist pal</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I used to know, barely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waiting in the car that I've never met.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's 13.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I need your help.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, what for? Why now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I read the papers, and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's not, really.
- No, not really.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was just one night.
- Yep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how you did it, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. We've been through this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nope.
- Yep!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how normal people behave.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't protect you out there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is... Is that normal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a big bunny. Relax about it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still haven't even
told me you liked it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked you three...
You don't like it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not even up for discussion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we...
- I said no. What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we need to worry about that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said, we can't stay here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move! I'm right behind you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Tony!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, Ms. Potts
is clear of the structure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, where's my flight power?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, the suit is not combat ready.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's two.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, take a deep breath.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flight power restored.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, kill the alarm. I got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis. Not my idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta get Pepper-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who asked you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the suit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open it, J.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's brisk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't leave me, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark secure server now transferring
to all known receivers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper, it's me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, it's Christmas time
and the rabbit's too big.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Done. Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm sorry in advance</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I can't come home yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to find this guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get you comfy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You happy now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice potato gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barrel's a little long.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Between that and the wide gauge,
it's gonna diminish your FPS.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you're out of ammo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that thing on your chest?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an electromagnet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should know,
you got a box of them right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does it power?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's...
Is that Iron Man?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, you're dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Valid point.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built him. I take care of him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fix him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a mechanic?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's "Iron Patriot" now-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's way cooler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyways, I would have added in
the retro...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not a good idea.
- Oops.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, who's home?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom already left for the diner,
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess he won,
because that was 6 years ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's what I need.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the pneumatic actuator
from your bazooka over there,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's in it for me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you know that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got just the thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a pinata for a cricket.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it discourages bullying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal? What do you say?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Deal.
- Deal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harley. And you're...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mechanic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what keeps
going through my head?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Where's my sandwich?"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Tony Stark?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark secure server.
Retinal scan verified.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper, it's me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why were you at the house tonight?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if you still want to talk about it</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Tony says you're a botanist. So...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But sure, you can call me a botanist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This boss of yours,
does he have a name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Aldrich Killian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We took the house down, sir.
But there's no sign of a body.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I see.
- No Stark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The master is about to record
and he's a little...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know how he gets.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you want to get shot in the face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Report in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Path is clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The master is travelling.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, what are we waiting for?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the rest of the materials, I'll make do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- ...l was kind of hoping</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for something a little more
adult than that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's 6.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When can we talk about New York?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe never. Relax about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the official story here?
What happened?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess this guy named Chad Davis
used to live roundabouts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won a bunch of medals in the army.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he blew himself up, right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 6 people died, right?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That doesn't make sense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 dead. Only 5 shadows.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except the bomb guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why there's only 5.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what
this crater reminds me of?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That giant Wormhole in New York.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it remind you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they coming back? The aliens?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe. Can you stop?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this subject make you edgy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have medication?
- No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going completely mental?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can stop. Do you want me to stop?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember when I said
to stop doing that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear that you're gonna freak me out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, you did it, didn't you?
You happy now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I say?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Wait up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your fault. You spazzed me out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, back to business.
Where were we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy who died.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relatives? Mom?
Mrs. Davis, where is she?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where she always is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Now, you're being helpful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice haircut. it suits you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice watch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. A limited edition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't doubt it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, have a good evening.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Davis?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I join you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Free country.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where would you like to start?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know
what you think happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Supposed to meet someone here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone used him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a weapon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called an arrest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Homeland Security. We good here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we're not "good."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a little more information
than that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Why don't you get on the horn
to Nashville, and upgrade me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the fun way is always good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deputy, get this woman out of...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all you got?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me go!
- Help me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I want my goddamn file."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not your fault, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember what I told you
about bullies?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like that, Westworld?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the thing about smart guys,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we always cover our ass.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what? Did I miss something?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, saving your life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Admit it, you need me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're connected.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">keep your trap shut, guard the suit,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stay connected to the telephone,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you feel that? We're done here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm cold.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can tell. You know how I can tell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we're connected.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was worth a shot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It goes with any decor...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying. There's nothing I can...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, where is the feed coming from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not just our station.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about a backup manual?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Vice President,
I think you should see this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, not again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the President getting this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only two lessons remain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meet Thomas Richards.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good strong name. Good strong job.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm sure he's a really good guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to shoot him in the head,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">live on your television, in 30 seconds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom lives.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did he hack my phone?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't allow terrorists to dictate...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to make this call.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd strongly advise against that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the right thing to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because nothing,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can save you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you soon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Patriot is ready to strike.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right now.
- Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on a second.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever have a chick straddling you,
and you look up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, pal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you came looking for me.
What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat right now, I need your login.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the same as it's always been,
"WarMachine68."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And password, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the 80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your login.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"WAR MACHINE ROX"
with an "X," all caps.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is so much better
than "lron Patriot."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very nice. Very nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have one question for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you like
for Christmas this year?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, David...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not erase a programme from
my DVR unless you are 100% sure...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One more time!
Ms. Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you erase my shows!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ain't gonna cut it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We talked about this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you were still alive!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on in. Close the door.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Can I just say, sir...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am your biggest fan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Just us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. What's your name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gary
- Gary</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow.
- Right there is fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get a lot of this, it's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you can tell,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I have patterned
my whole look after you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My hair's a little...
- it's fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Hispanic Scott Baio.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have enough juice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recalibrate the lSDNs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pump it up by about 40%.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony needs Gary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Gary needs Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you please state your name
for the camera?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellen Brandt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Addiction will not be tolerated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those who cannot regulate
will be out from the programme.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once misfits, cripples...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the next iteration
of human evolution.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody, before we start...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today is your glory-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's begin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get her out!
Get them out of here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sold it to the Mandarin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got you, pal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fun fact.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before he built rockets for the Nazis,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the idealistic Wernher von Braun</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dreamed of space travel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He stargazed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what he said
when the first V-2 hit London?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The rocket performed perfectly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It just landed on the wrong planet."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you look up,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're a long way from shore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's exactly what we used to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, don't judge yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Pepper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really appreciate that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya, run!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Pepper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to fix this thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark, when he threatened us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've told you, Killian, we can use him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is support team Blue-Zero.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Support Blue-Zero,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">involves cheaply-made sportswear,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you messed up again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you're free, if you weren't before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's... Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iron Patriot on the job.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy to help.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to thank me, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my pleasure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want this suit,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the plan, Colonel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, how are we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then at the end of the sentence,
I say the wrong cranberry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, sir, you were right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, sir, it's in Miami.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but not right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harley, where is he really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does say Miami, Florida.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not charging.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's questionable about electricity?
All right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my suit, and I can't...
I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, not again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you having another attack?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even mention New York.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, what am I gonna do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just breathe. Really, just breathe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a mechanic, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just build something?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, kid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My fault again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, which one of you is Vanessa?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nessie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's some guy over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bloody hell. Bloody hell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Although the guns are all fake</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heard enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here.
He's here, but he's not here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It is.
- It's complicated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A decoy? You're a double, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," it's not real.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how did you get here, Trevor?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I had a little problem
with substances.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Next?
- Then,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they approached me
about the role,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they knew about the drugs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did they say?
They'd get you off them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said they'd give me more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave me things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave me things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just nod off?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, and a lovely speedboat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the thing was, he needed someone</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to take credit
for some accidental explosions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Killian?
- Killian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He created you?
- He created me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Custom-made terror threat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His think tank thinked it up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pathology of a serial killer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The manipulation
of Western iconography.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready for another lesson?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blah, blah, blah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your performance?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where people died?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they didn't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he might not wake up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're gonna have
to answer for that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're still going down, pal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You under...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have pressed
the panic button.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just like old times, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't my idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. So you took Killian's card.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took his money.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot has happened, Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya, you're kidding yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then help me fix it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I do that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember the night, not the morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this what
you've been chasing around?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used to have a moral psychology.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used to have ideals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted to help people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now look at you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get to wake up every morning
with someone who</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">still has their soul.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me out of here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what my old man
used to say to me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of his favourite of many sayings...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The early bird gets the worm,
but the second mouse gets the cheese."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I be pissed at you, Tony?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think back to Switzerland,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well for the first 20 minutes,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually thought you'd show up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the next hour...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I considered taking
that one-step shortcut to the lobby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you know what I mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as I looked out over that city,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no one was even looking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a thought that would guide me
for years to come.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anonymity, Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You simply rule
from behind the scenes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the second
you give evil a face,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you hand the people a target.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're something else.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have met him, I assume?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a stage actor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, the point is,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">subtlety has kind of had its day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's next for you in your world?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to repay you the self same gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this is live.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the body is trying to decide whether to
accept EXTREMIS, or just give up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if it gives up,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We haven't even talked salary yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let him go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, let him go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maya, give me the injector.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I die, Killian,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not doing this, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The good news is,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a high-level position
has just been vacated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a maniac.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm a visionary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do own a maniac.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he takes the stage tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we get the Patriot installed,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will take me
9 or 10 minutes for the takedown.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great, but the last time I looked,
there was somebody inside of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Afternoon, gentlemen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Colonel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step aside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll get you out of there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll damage the armour.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can fix it, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want Potts with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's still in Phase 2.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going deaf, are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, there. It's a limited edition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ponytail Express.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">832 miles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm good like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you stop that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break it, you bought it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I bought it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're zip-tied to a bed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you coming out?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You breathe fire? Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a glorious day, Savin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time tomorrow,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the world's most feared terrorist
in the other.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll own the war on terror.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Create supply and demand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, for your brothers and sisters.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the ground in 5, 4, 3...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! 2...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did we get this shift?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put down your weapons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 5, 4, bang!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am just beyond terrified.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it comes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 3, 4...
- Shut up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5, 4, 3, 2, 1!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Told you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the rest?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better late than never.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this time. Not the face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crap.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You got yours?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's somebody I'd like you to meet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, you, you! Move! Get out!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this? I had winners.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you come as?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You make a move,
and I break your face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the Mandarin?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doing what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it! That hurt. I get it! I get it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do know it's happening
off the coast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something to do with a big boat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can take you there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ole', ole', ole', ole'...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this next bit may include
the vice president as well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...
Is that important?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we gonna do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have any transport.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ringo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we also have to figure out</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- this vice president thing, right?
- Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder who I'm calling right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the vice president.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, this is Tony Stark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome back to the land of the living.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">surrounded by the Agency's finest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're good, here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to immediately
alert that plane.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything okay, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't be better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, babe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel Rhodes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta make a decision.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I have an update from Malibu.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cranes have finally arrived,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what about the suit I'm wearing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The armour is now at 92%.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's going to have to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get a quick picture.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything all right, Colonel?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is an honour, Mr. President.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're gonna do it, do it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool your boots, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not how the Mandarin works.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Internal shots, temperature spikes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me eyes on it now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Image coming through now, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that Rhodes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is anyone there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us out!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The President.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try the jet stream?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of which, go fish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many in the air?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">13, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How many can I carry?
- 4, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! No! No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me. See that guy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got it?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can do this, Heather.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, see? 11 more to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what we're going to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18,000 feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10,000 feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6,000 feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1,000 feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">400 feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">200 feet, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice work, guys!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Jarvis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That came out of nowhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me some good news, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think they all made it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but I missed the president.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't save the president
with the suit,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, Jarvis, is it that time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The House Party Protocol, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Correct.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think he's gonna help you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here as my...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trophy-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome aboard, Mr. President.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, 2 years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the Roxxon Norco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, of course, you'll remember</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want from me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, I've moved on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found myself a new political patron,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">String him up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's strung up over the oil tanker.
They're gonna light him up, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Viking funeral.
Public execution.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, death by oil.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. That's good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is your gun up?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. What do I do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay on my 6, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6, high, back. All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that? Nailed it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you really killed the glass.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I was aiming for the bulb?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't hit a bulb at this distance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All personnel, we have hostiles</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- on east unit 12.
- Over there!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give me...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got, like, 5 of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's what I'm going to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save my spot, ready?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 guys, one girl, all armed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I would kill
for some armour right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are those...
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merry Christmas, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disable with extreme prejudice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take them to church.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody needs a hobby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice timing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What does that mean?
- I got you covered.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very funny.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I've located Ms. Potts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're such a jerk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. A little more, baby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this guy bothering you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it hot in there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's watching.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you should close your eyes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close your eyes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you take a minute.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, give me a suit right now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just hold on. Hold on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brace yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look damn good, Mr. President,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm gonna need that suit back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The President is secure, Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm clearing the area.
- Nice work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look at me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, I can't reach any further
and you can't stay there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right?
You've got to let go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A shame. I would've caught her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eject.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, here we are on the roof.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mark 42, inbound.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really didn't deserve her, Tony.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right. I don't deserve her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's where you're wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was already perfect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do me a favour and blow Mark 42.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more false faces.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you wanted the Mandarin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're looking right at him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the Mandarin!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?
What, are you mad at me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was really violent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the hot mess now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's still debatable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sport bra. The whole deal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I going to complain
about now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll think of something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not hot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I gonna be okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think I can figure this out, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I can get you better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I do. I fix stuff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And all your distractions?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jarvis. Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so far?
Do you like it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It Will do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You start with something pure,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The compromises.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We create our own demons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great to see you! Bloody hell!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.
It took some tinkering.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, there are people who say
progress is dangerous,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, neither will I.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a hobby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a cocoon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a changed man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can take away my house,
and all my tricks and toys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One thing you can't take away...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Iron Man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, and thank you by the way.
For listening.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, something about getting it off
my chest,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and putting it out there in the
atmosphere instead of holding this in...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my experiences with someone,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it just cuts the weight of it in half.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything comes full circle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the fact that you've been able to
help me process...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were at...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you actively napping?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was... I... I drifted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did I lose you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elevator in Switzerland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you heard none of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a therapist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not my training.
- So?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't have the...
- What? The time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Temperament.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
Now that I think about it...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, my original wound.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 1983, all right?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.</font>
