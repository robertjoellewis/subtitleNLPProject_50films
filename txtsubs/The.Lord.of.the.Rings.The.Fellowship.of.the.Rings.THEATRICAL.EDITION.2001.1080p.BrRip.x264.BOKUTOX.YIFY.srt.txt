The world is changed.
I feel it in the water.
I feel it in the earth.
I smell it in the air.
Much that once was...
...is lost.
For none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.
Three were given to the Elves:
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.
And nine...
...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...
...who, above all else, desire power.
For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived.
For another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...
...to control all others.
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...
...and his will to dominate all life.
One Ring to rule them all.
One by one...
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.
But there were some who resisted.
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for Middle-earth's freedom.
Victory was near.
But the power of the Ring...
...could not be undone.
It was in this moment...
...when all hope had faded...
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.
The Ring passed to Isildur...
...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.
But the hearts of Men...
...are easily corrupted.
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.
It betrayed Isildur to his death.
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...
...were lost.
History became legend...
...legend became myth.
And for 2500 years...
...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.
Until, when chance came...
...it ensnared a new bearer.
My precious.
The Ring came to the creature Gollum...
...who took it deep
into the Misty Mountains.
And there it consumed him.
It came to me.
My own. My love. My own.
My precious.
The Ring
brought to Gollum unnatural long life.
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.
Darkness crept back into
the forests of the world.
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...
...whispers of a nameless fear.
And the Ring of Power perceived...
...its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.
What's this?
A Hobbit.
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
A ring.
Lost!
My precious is lost!
For the time will soon come...
...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.
Down from the door where it began
And I must follow if I can
The road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began
Now far ahead the road has gone
- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
What news of the world?
Tell me everything.
Everything? You're far too eager
and curious for a Hobbit.
Most unnatural.
What can I tell you?
Life in the wide world goes on
much as it has this past Age.
Full of its own comings and goings.
Scarcely aware of the existence
of Hobbits.
For which I am very thankful.
It's Gandalf!
Oh, the long-expected party.
How is the old rascal?
I hear it'll be a party
of special magnificence.
You know Bilbo.
He's got the place in an uproar.
That should please him.
- Half the Shire's invited.
- Gracious me.
He's up to something.
All right, then. Keep your secrets.
Before you came along,
Bagginses were well thought of.
Never had any adventures.
If you're referring to the dragon
incident, I was barely involved.
All I did was give your uncle
a nudge out of the door.
Well, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.
Oh, really?
Gandalf! Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf?
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.
So am I.
Whoa, whoa.
No, thank you!
We don't want any visitors,
well-wishers or relations!
And what about very old friends?
Gandalf?
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?
You haven't aged a day.
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome.
Oh, here we are.
Tea? Or maybe something stronger?
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?
Just tea, thank you.
Oh.
I expected you last week.
But you come and go as you please.
You always have.
I'm a bit unprepared. We've only got
cold chicken and pickle...
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.
I've just found some sponge cake.
I could make eggs...
Oh, Gandalf?
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.
- Mind if I eat?
- No, not at all.
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
I'm not at home!
I must get away
from these confounded relatives...
...never giving me any peace.
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.
- You mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes. It's all in hand.
All the arrangements are made.
Oh, thank you.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...
...not some blockhead from Hardbottle.
You will tell him, won't you?
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.
I know.
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.
In his heart, Frodo's still in love
with the Shire.
The woods, the fields.
Little rivers.
I am old, Gandalf.
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.
I feel thin.
Sort of stretched...
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.
And I don't expect I shall return.
In fact, I mean not to.
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.
Ah.
Gandalf, my old friend...
...this will be a night to remember.
Hello, hello.
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.
- I'll just have another ale.
- No, you don't.
Go on!
So there I was...
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.
And they were all arguing...
...about how to cook us.
Whether it be turned on a spit or
if they should squash us into jelly.
They spent so much time arguing
whithertos and whyfors...
...that the sun's first light
crept over the trees...
...and turned them all to stone!
Quickly.
Whoa!
Up they go!
No, the big one.
- Done!
- It should be in the ground.
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!
Bilbo!
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
There hasn't been a dragon here
for 1000 years.
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might've known.
Speech, Bilbo!
Speech!
Speech!
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...
...Tooks and Brandybucks...
...Grubbs, Chubbs...
...Hornblowers...
...Bolgers...
...Bracegirdles...
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!
Today is my 111th birthday!
Happy birthday!
But alas, 111 years is far too short
a time to live among...
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.
I don't know half of you
as well as I'd like...
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.
I, uh...
I have things to do.
I've put this off far too long.
I regret to announce this is the end!
I'm going now.
I bid you all a very fond farewell.
Goodbye.
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?
There are many magic rings in this
world. None should be used lightly.
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.
- You will keep an eye on Frodo?
- Two eyes.
As often as I can spare them.
- I'm leaving him everything.
- What about the ring?
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.
No. Wait, it's...
...here in my pocket.
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?
Yet, after all, why not?
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- You should leave the ring behind.
Is that so hard?
Well, no.
And yes.
Now it comes,
I don't feel like parting with it.
It's mine. It came to me!
- There's no need to get angry.
- Lf I'm angry, it's your fault!
It's mine.
My own.
- My precious.
- Precious?
It's been called that before,
but not by you.
What business is it of yours
what I do?
I think you've had that ring
long enough.
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.
I am not trying to rob you.
I'm trying to help you.
All your long years,
we've been friends.
Trust me as you once did.
Let it go.
You're right, Gandalf.
The ring must go to Frodo.
It's late. The road is long.
Yes, it is time.
- Bilbo.
- Hm?
The ring is still in your pocket.
Yes.
I've thought up an ending for my book:
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days. "
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.
Goodbye, Gandalf.
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.
The road goes ever on and on
Until our next meeting.
It's mine. My own.
My precious.
Riddles in the dark.
Bilbo! Bilbo!
My precious.
Precious.
He's gone, hasn't he?
He talked for so long about leaving...
...I didn't think he'd really do it.
Gandalf?
Bilbo's ring.
He's gone to stay with the Elves.
He's left you Bag End.
Along with all his possessions.
The ring is yours now.
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?
- I must see to things.
- What things?
- Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
Keep it secret.
Keep it safe.
Shire!
Baggins!
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...
...and the finding
of the Ring of Power. "
"It has come to me.
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.
All those in my line
shall be bound to its fate...
...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.
It is precious to me...
...though I buy it with great pain.
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.
The writing, which was as clear
as flame, has all but disappeared.
A secret now
that only fire can tell. "
Shire.
Baggins.
There's no Bagginses here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.
That way.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Sam.
Is it secret? Is it safe?
Ah.
What are you doing?
Hold out your hand, Frodo.
It's quite cool.
What can you see?
Can you see anything?
Nothing.
There's nothing.
Wait.
There are markings.
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.
There are few who can.
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.
Mordor!
In the common tongue, it says:
"One Ring to rule them all...
...One Ring to find them...
...One Ring to bring them all...
...and in the darkness bind them. "
This is the One Ring...
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.
Bilbo found it.
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.
The Ring has awoken.
It's heard its master's call.
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.
No, Frodo.
The spirit of Sauron endured.
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.
Sauron has returned.
His Orcs have multiplied.
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in Mordor.
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.
He is seeking it.
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.
For the Ring yearns above all else...
...to return to the hand
of its master.
They are one...
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.
Frodo...
...he must never find it.
All right.
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.
No one knows it's here, do they?
Do they, Gandalf?
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.
But the enemy found him first.
I don't know
how long they tortured him.
But amidst the screams and inane
babble, they discerned two words:
Shire!
Baggins!
Shire.
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!
Who goes there?
Take it, Gandalf!
- Take it!
- No.
- You must!
- You cannot offer me this!
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!
I dare not take it.
Not even to keep it safe.
Understand, Frodo...
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.
No, it can't.
What must I do?
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where do I go?
Out of the Shire. The village of Bree.
Bree.
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.
I don't have any answers.
I must see the head of my order.
He's both wise and powerful. Trust me.
He'll know what to do.
You'll have to leave the name
Baggins behind.
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.
I can cut across country
easily enough.
My dear Frodo.
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
You can learn all their ways
in a month.
And yet, after 100 years...
...they can still surprise you.
Get down.
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Were you eavesdropping?
I haven't been dropping no eaves.
I was cutting grass under the window.
A little late for trimming the verge!
- I heard voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!
Nothing important.
I heard about a ring, a Dark Lord
and the end of the world...
Please, Mr. Gandalf, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.
No?
Perhaps not.
I've thought of a better use for you.
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.
Be careful, both of you.
The enemy has many spies
in his service:
Birds, beasts.
Is it safe?
Never put it on...
...for the Dark Lord's agents
will be drawn to its power.
Always remember...
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.
It wants to be found.
This is it.
This is what?
If I take one more step...
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.
Come on, Sam.
Remember what Bilbo said:
- "It's a dangerous business... "
"Frodo, going out your door.
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...
...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to. "
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.
The hour grows late.
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...
...seeking my counsel.
For that is why you have come,
is it not?
My old friend.
Saruman.
You are sure of this?
Beyond any doubt.
So the Ring of Power has been found.
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not see it.
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.
But we still have time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
Time?
What time do you think we have?
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.
He cannot yet take physical form...
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
The Eye of Sauron.
He is gathering all evil to him.
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army
great enough to attack Middle-earth.
You know this?
How?
I have seen it.
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.
Why?
Why should we fear to use it?
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.
We do not know who else
may be watching.
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving.
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
The Nine?
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...
...disguised as riders in black.
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.
And kill the one who carries it.
Frodo!
You did not think a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.
Against the power of Mordor...
...there can be no victory.
We must join with him, Gandalf.
We must join with Sauron.
It would be wise, my friend.
Tell me...
...friend...
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?
I gave you the chance...
...of aiding me willingly...
...but you have elected
the way of pain!
Mr. Frodo?
Frodo! Frodo!
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?
- It's something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee. "
And I don't mean to.
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?
- Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello.
Get off him.
Come on, Frodo.
What's the meaning of this?
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
You get back here!
Get out of my field!
You'd better watch out
when I catch you!
I don't know why he's upset.
It's only carrots.
And some cabbages.
And those bags of potatoes
we lifted last week.
- And the mushrooms the week before.
Yes, Pippin. My point is...
...he's clearly overreacting.
Run!
Oh, that was close.
I think I've broken something.
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut.
- Shortcut to what?
- Mushrooms!
That's mine.
That's nice, Merry.
Here's a nice one, Sam.
I think we should get off the road.
Get off the road!
Quick!
Be quiet!
What was that?
Anything?
Nothing.
What is going on?
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.
Frodo?
Get down!
I have to leave the Shire.
Sam and I must get to Bree.
Right.
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.
Run!
This way! Follow me!
Run!
Get the rope, Sam!
Frodo!
Run, Frodo!
Go!
Hurry!
Come on!
Come on! Faster!
Jump!
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.
Come on.
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!
- What brings you to Bree?
- We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.
It's my job to ask questions
after dark.
There's talk of strange folk abroad.
Can't be too careful.
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.
Excuse me.
Good evening, little masters.
If you need accommodation, we got
cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.
Mister?
Underhill. My name's Underhill.
- Underhill.
- We're friends of Gandalf.
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf? Gandalf.
Oh, yes...
...I remember. Elderly chap.
Big grey beard, pointy hat.
Not seen him for six months.
What do we do now?
Sam...
...he'll be here. He'll come.
Get out of my way!
What's that?
This, my friend, is a pint.
It comes in pints?
- I'm getting one.
- You got a half already!
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.
Excuse me.
That Man in the corner. Who is he?
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.
I've never heard his right name,
but he's known as Strider.
Strider.
Baggins.
Baggins.
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.
He's my cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...
...and twice removed...
- Pippin!
- Steady on.
You cannot hide.
I see you.
There is no life...
...in the void.
Only...
...death.
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill. "
- What do you want?
- More caution. That's no trinket.
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.
I can avoid being seen if I wish...
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?
Yes.
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.
You have a stout heart, Hobbit.
But that will not save you.
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.
What are they?
They were once Men.
Great kings of Men.
Then Sauron gave to them
nine rings of power.
Blinded by greed,
they took them without question.
One by one, falling into darkness.
Now they are slaves to his will.
They are the NazgûI.
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.
At all times they feel...
...the presence of the Ring...
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?
We have no choice but to trust him.
- Where is he leading us?
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.
- To the house of Elrond.
Did you hear? Rivendell.
We're going to see the Elves.
- We do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?
- You had it.
- We've had one, yes.
What about second breakfast?
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast.
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.
Pippin!
The power of Isengard
is at your command...
...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?
We have work to do.
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.
Rip them all down.
This was the great watchtower
of Amon SûI.
We shall rest here tonight.
These are for you.
Keep them close.
I'm going to have a look around.
Stay here.
My tomato's burst.
Could I have some bacon?
Want a tomato?
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, crispy bacon.
We saved some for you.
Put it out, fools!
That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!
Go!
Back, you devils!
Frodo!
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.
Strider!
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.
Hurry!
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!
Hold on, Frodo.
Gandalf!
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.
Is he going to die?
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll become a Wraith like them.
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.
It's a weed.
It may help slow the poisoning.
Hurry!
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?
Frodo.
Who is she?
Frodo.
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.
He's not going to last.
We must get him to my father.
- I've been looking for you.
- Where are you going?
There are five Wraiths behind you.
I don't know where the other four are.
What are they saying?
ARWEN:
I do not fear them.
Arwen...
...ride hard. Don't look back.
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.
If you want him, come and claim him.
No. No!
Frodo, no.
Frodo, don't give in.
Not now.
What grace is given me...
...let it pass to him.
Let him be spared.
Save him.
- Where am I?
You're in the house of Elrond.
It's 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.
And you're lucky to be here too.
A few more hours and you'd
have been beyond our aid.
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.
What happened, Gandalf?
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.
I was delayed.
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.
Embrace the power of the Ring...
...or embrace your own destruction!
There is only one Lord of the Ring.
Only one who can bend it to his will.
And he does not share power.
So you have chosen death.
Gandalf? What is it?
Nothing, Frodo.
Frodo!
Frodo!
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!
Sam has hardly left your side.
We were that worried about you.
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Bilbo.
"There and Back Again:
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. "
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...
...visit Lake-town...
...see the Lonely Mountain again.
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.
I miss the Shire.
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.
I'm not like you, Bilbo.
My dear boy.
Now, what have I forgot?
- Packed already?
No harm in being prepared.
- But you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.
- More than anything.
- I did.
It's just...
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.
Off home.
You're right, Sam.
We did what we set out to do.
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.
I am ready to go home.
His strength returns.
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.
To have come so far
bearing the Ring...
...he's shown extraordinary resilience
to its evil.
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
Sauron's forces are massing
in the East. He's fixed on Rivendell.
Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
Our list of allies grows thin.
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.
Saruman has crossed Orcs
with Goblin-men.
He's breeding an army in Isengard.
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.
Saruman is coming for the Ring.
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
Gandalf...
...the Ring cannot stay here.
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.
They must decide now how to end it.
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving.
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?
They seek riches. They care nothing
for the troubles of others.
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.
Men?
Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.
The blood of Númenor is spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.
It is because of Men the Ring survives.
I was there, Gandalf.
I was there 3000 years ago...
...when Isildur took the Ring.
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...
...where the Ring was forged
and could be destroyed.
Cast it into the fire!
- Destroy it!
- No.
Isildur!
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.
- They're divided, leaderless.
- There's one who can unite them.
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.
He turned from that path
a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.
The shards of Narsil.
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.
It's still sharp.
But no more than a broken heirloom.
Why do you fear the past?
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.
You are not bound to his fate.
The same blood flows in my veins.
The same weakness.
Your time will come.
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.
You said you'd bind yourself to me...
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.
And to that I hold.
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.
I choose a mortal life.
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...
...like my heart.
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.
Middle-earth is on the brink of
destruction. None can escape it.
You will unite, or you will fall.
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
So it is true.
The doom of Man.
- It is a gift.
A gift to the foes of Mordor.
Why not use this Ring?
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...
...are your lands kept safe.
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.
The Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?
This is no mere Ranger.
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
You owe him your allegiance.
Aragorn.
This is Isildur's heir?
And heir to the throne of Gondor.
Gondor has no king.
Gondor needs no king.
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.
You have only one choice.
The Ring must be destroyed.
What are we waiting for?
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of GIóin...
...by any craft that we here possess.
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.
Only there can it be unmade.
It must be taken deep into Mordor...
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.
One of you...
...must do this.
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.
There is evil there
that does not sleep.
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.
It is a barren wasteland...
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.
Have you heard nothing
Lord Elrond has said?
- The Ring must be destroyed.
- And you think you can do it!
And if we fail, what happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?
I'll be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!
Never trust an Elf!
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!
I will take it.
I will take the Ring to Mordor.
Though...
...I do not know the way.
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...
...as long as it is yours to bear.
If by my life
or death I can protect you...
...I will.
You have my sword.
And you have my bow.
And my ax.
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...
...then Gondor will see it done.
- Hey!
- He can't go without me.
- It's not possible to separate you...
...even when he's summoned
to a secret Council and you're not.
We're coming too!
You'll have to tie us up to stop us.
You need people of intelligence
on this sort of...
...mission.
Quest.
Thing.
Well, that rules you out, Pip.
Nine companions.
So be it.
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.
Great!
Where are we going?
My old sword!
Sting.
Here, take it.
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.
It's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.
Here's a pretty thing.
Mithril.
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.
Let me see you put it on. Come on.
Oh!
My old ring.
I should very much like...
...to hold it again, one last time.
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.
I'm sorry for everything.
We hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will be open to us.
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.
Move your feet.
- Good, Pip.
- Thanks.
Faster!
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which they're not...
...I'd say we were taking
the long way.
We could pass through
the Mines of Moria.
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.
Sorry!
Get him!
For the Shire!
Hold him down, Merry!
You've got my arm!
- What is that?
- It's just a wisp of cloud.
It's moving fast.
Against the wind.
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!
- Hurry!
- Take cover!
Spies of Saruman.
The passage south is being watched.
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.
Frodo!
Boromir.
It is a strange fate we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...
...over so small a thing.
Such a little thing.
Boromir!
Give the Ring to Frodo.
As you wish.
I care not.
So, Gandalf, you tried
to lead them over Caradhras.
And if that fails,
where then will you go?
If the mountain defeats you...
...will you risk
a more dangerous road?
There is a fell voice on the air.
It's Saruman!
He's trying to bring down the
mountain! We must turn back!
No!
Get off the mountain!
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:
Shadow and flame.
Let the Ring-bearer decide.
Frodo?
We will go through the mines.
So be it.
The walls...
...of Moria.
Well, let's see.
Ithildin.
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.
- Speak, friend, and enter. "
- What do you suppose that means?
Simple. If you're a friend, speak
the password. The doors will open.
Mines are no place for a pony.
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.
Go on, Bill. Go on.
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.
Do not disturb the water.
Oh, it's useless.
It's a riddle.
"Speak 'friend' and enter. "
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?
Mellon.
Soon, Master Elf, you'll enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!
This, my friend,
is my cousin Balin's home.
And they call it a mine.
A mine!
This is no mine. It's a tomb.
No.
No...
No!
Goblins.
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.
Now, get out of here. Get out!
Frodo!
Help!
Strider!
Help!
Get off him!
Aragorn!
Frodo!
Strider!
Into the mines!
- Legolas!
Into the cave!
Run!
We now have but one choice.
We must face the long dark of Moria.
Be on your guard.
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...
...in the deep places of the world.
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.
Pippin.
I have no memory of this place.
Are we lost?
No.
I think we are.
Gandalf's thinking.
Merry?
What?
I'm hungry.
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...
...or was set loose.
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.
He'll never be rid of his need for it.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him.
Pity?
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.
Can you give it to them, Frodo?
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...
...before this is over.
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.
I wish the Ring
had never come to me...
...and none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such
times. That isn't for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that's given to us.
There are other forces at work
besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.
And that is an encouraging thought.
Ah!
It's that way.
- He's remembered.
No...
...but the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.
Let me risk a little more light.
Behold...
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.
Gimli!
No.
No!
No.
"Here lies Balin...
...son of Fundin...
...Lord of Moria. "
He is dead, then.
It's as I feared.
We must move on. We cannot linger.
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.
We have barred the gates...
...but cannot hold them for long.
The ground shakes.
Drums...
...drums in the deep.
We cannot get out.
A Shadow moves in the dark.
We cannot get out.
They are coming. "
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.
Frodo!
Orcs.
Back! Stay close to Gandalf!
They have a cave-troll.
Let them come!
There is one Dwarf in Moria
who still draws breath.
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
Frodo!
Aragorn! Aragorn!
Frodo!
Oh, no.
He's alive.
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.
You should be dead.
That would have skewered a wild boar.
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.
Mithril.
You're full of surprises, Mr. Baggins.
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!
This way!
What is this new devilry?
A Balrog.
A demon of the ancient world.
This foe is beyond any of you.
Run!
Quickly!
Gandalf.
Lead them on, Aragorn.
The bridge is near.
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.
Gandalf!
Merry! Pippin!
Sam!
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.
Not the beard!
Steady.
Hold on!
Hang on!
Lean forward!
Steady.
Come on!
Now!
Over the bridge!
Fly!
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!
Go back to the Shadow.
You shall not pass!
No! No!
- Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
No!
Aragorn!
Legolas, get them up.
Give them a moment!
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.
On your feet, Sam.
Frodo?
Frodo!
Stay close, young Hobbits!
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.
An Elf-witch...
...of terrible power.
All who look upon her...
...fall under her spell.
Frodo!
And are never seen again.
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.
Mr. Frodo?
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.
Aragorn, these woods are perilous.
We should go back.
You have entered the realm of the
Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back.
Come. She is waiting.
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.
Where is Gandalf?
For I much desire to speak with him.
He has fallen into Shadow.
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.
Stray but a little and it will fail...
...to the ruin of all.
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.
Tonight, you will sleep...
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...
...one who has seen the Eye!
A lament for Gandalf.
What do they say about him?
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.
Take some rest.
These borders are well-protected.
I will find no rest here.
I heard her voice inside my head.
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left. "
But I cannot see it.
It is long since we had any hope.
My father is a noble man.
But his rule is failing...
...and our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right,
and I'd do it.
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?
The White Tower of Ecthelion.
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.
Have you ever been called home...
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?
I have seen the White City...
...long ago.
One day, our paths will lead us there.
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:
"The Lords of Gondor have returned. "
Will you look into the mirror?
What will I see?
Even the wisest cannot tell.
For the mirror...
...shows many things.
Things that were...
...things that are...
...and some things...
...that have not yet come to pass.
I know what it is you saw.
For it is also in my mind.
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.
He will try to take the Ring.
You know of whom I speak.
One by one, it will destroy them all.
If you ask it of me...
...I will give you the One Ring.
You offer it to me freely.
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!
Treacherous as the sea!
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!
All shall love me...
...and despair.
I pass the test. I will diminish...
...and go into the West...
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...
...is to be alone.
This task was appointed to you.
And if you do not find a way...
...no one will.
Then I know what I must do.
It's just...
...I'm afraid to do it.
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?
They were Elves once.
Taken by the Dark Powers...
...tortured and mutilated.
A ruined and terrible form of life.
And now...
...perfected.
My fighting Uruk-hai...
...whom do you serve?
Saruman!
Hunt them down.
Do not stop until they are found.
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.
You will taste Man-flesh!
One of the halflings has something of
great value. Bring them to me alive...
...and unspoiled.
Kill the others.
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.
I give you the light of Eärendil...
...our most beloved star.
May it be a light for you
in dark places...
...when all other lights go out.
Frodo.
The Argonath.
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.
My kin.
We cross the lake at nightfall.
Hide the boats and continue on foot.
- We approach Mordor from the North.
Oh, yes?
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.
And after that, it gets even better.
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.
That is our road.
Take some rest
and recover your strength.
Recover my...
- We should leave now.
- No.
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.
A shadow and a threat has been growing
in my mind.
Something draws near.
I can feel it.
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.
Where's Frodo?
We shouldn't wander alone.
You, least of all.
So much depends on you.
Frodo?
I know why you seek solitude.
You suffer. I see it day by day.
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?
There are other ways, Frodo.
- Other paths we might take.
- I know what you would say.
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.
Warning? Against what?
We're all afraid, Frodo.
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy our hope...
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!
- Lend me the Ring.
- No.
- Why do you recoil? I'm no thief.
- You're not yourself.
What chance do you think you have?
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.
And you will beg for death
before the end!
You fool!
It is not yours, save by chance!
It could have been mine.
It should be mine! Give it to me!
- Give it to me!
- No!
- Give it!
- No.
I see your mind.
You will take the Ring to Sauron!
You will betray us!
You'll go to your death,
the death of us all!
Curse you!
Curse you and all halflings!
Frodo?
Frodo.
What have I done?
Please, Frodo.
Frodo, I'm sorry!
Frodo!
Frodo?
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?
Stay away!
Frodo!
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?
Would you destroy it?
Aragorn.
Aragorn.
Elessar.
I would have gone with you to the end.
Into the very fires of Mordor.
I know.
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.
Go, Frodo!
Run.
Run!
Mr. Frodo!
Find the halfling!
Elendil!
Aragorn, go!
Frodo!
Hide here. Quick!
Come on!
What's he doing?
He's leaving.
- No!
- Pippin!
Run, Frodo. Go on!
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!
- Over here!
- This way!
- It's working!
- I know! Run!
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.
Run!
No.
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.
Frodo. Where is Frodo?
I let Frodo go.
Then you did what I could not.
I tried to take the Ring from him.
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.
I did not see it.
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.
You fought bravely.
You have kept your honor.
Leave it.
It is over.
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...
...and my city to ruin.
I don't know what strength
is in my blood...
...but I swear to you,
I won't let the White City fall...
...nor our people fail.
Our people.
I would have followed you, my brother.
My captain.
My king.
Be at peace...
...son of Gondor.
Frodo!
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live
to see such times...
...but that is not for them to decide.
All you have to decide...
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.
Frodo, no!
Frodo!
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.
Go back, Sam!
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.
And I'm coming with you!
You can't swim!
Sam!
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee. "
And I don't mean to.
I don't mean to.
Sam.
Come on.
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.
- You mean not to follow them.
- His fate is no longer in our hands.
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.
Not if we hold true to each other.
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.
We travel light.
Let us hunt some Orc.
Yes!
Mordor.
I hope the others find a safer road.
Strider will look after them.
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
We may.
Sam...
...I'm glad you're with me.
