<i>Once upon a time in a
kingdom far, far away,</i>
<i>the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.</i>
<i>And throughout the land,
everyone was happy...</i>
<i>until the sun went down</i>
<i>and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment</i>
<i>that took hold each
and every night.</i>
<i>Desperate, they sought the
help of a fairy godmother</i>
<i>who had them lock the young
princess away in a tower,</i>
<i>there to await the kiss... of
the handsome Prince Charming.</i>
<i>It was he who would chance
the perilous journey</i>
<i>through blistering cold
and scorching desert</i>
<i>travelling for many
days and nights,</i>
<i>risking life and limb</i>
<i>to reach the Dragon's keep.</i>
For he was the bravest,
and most handsome...
in all the land.
And it was destiny that his kiss
would break the dreaded curse.
He alone would climb to the
highest room of the tallest tower
to enter the princess's chambers, cross
the room to her sleeping silhouette,
pull back the gossamer curtains to find her...
What?
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!
Oh, thank heavens. Where is she?
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?
<i>So she said what's
the problem, baby?</i>
<i>What's the problem?
I don't know.</i>
<i>Well, maybe I'm in love.</i>
<i>Think about it everytime
I think about it.</i>
<i>Can't stop thinking about it.</i>
<i>How much longer will
it take to cure this?</i>
<i>Just to cure it, 'cause
I can't ignore it.</i>
<i>If it's love, love.</i>
<i>Makes me wanna turn
around and face me.</i>
<i>But I don't know
nothing about love.</i>
<i>Oh, come on, come on</i>
<i>Turn a little faster.</i>
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>The world will follow after.</i>
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>Everybody's after love.</i>
<i>So I said I'm a
snowball running.</i>
<i>Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love.</i>
<i>Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight.</i>
<i>Shimmering love.</i>
<i>Well, baby, I surrender.</i>
<i>To the strawberry ice cream.</i>
<i>Never ever end of
all this love.</i>
<i>Well, I didn't mean to do it.</i>
<i>But there's no
escaping your love.</i>
<i>These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone.</i>
<i>Never alone, no, no.</i>
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>Jump a little higher.</i>
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>If you feel a little lighter.</i>
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>We were once upon
a time in love.</i>
Hyah!
<i>We're accidentally in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally.</i>
<i>I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love.</i>
<i>I'm in love, I'm in love.</i>
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>
<i>I'm in love.</i>
<i>I'm in love.</i>
It's so good to be home!
Just you and me and...
<i>- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?</i>
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you
two a sight for sore eyes!
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How
about a side of sugar for the steed?
Donkey, what are you doing here?
Taking care of your
love nest for you.
Oh, you mean like... sorting the
mail and watering the plants?
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.
You do now. I call that one
Shrek and the other Fiona.
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...
Look at the time. I guess
you'd better be going.
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you
be getting home to Dragon?
Oh, yeah, that.
I don't know. She's been all
moody and stuff lately.
I thought I'd move in with you.
You know we're always
happy to see you, Donkey.
But Fiona and I are married now.
We need a little time, you
know, to be together.
Just with each other.
Alone.
Say no more. You don't have
to worry about a thing.
I will always be here to make
sure nobody bothers you.
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?
You're bothering me.
Oh, Okay. All right, cool.
I guess...
Me and Pinocchio was going to
catch a tournament, anyway, so...
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.
He'll be fine. Now,
where were we?
Oh.
I think I remember.
Donkey!
I know, I know! Alone! I'm going!
I'm going.
What do you want me to
tell these other guys?
Enough, Reggie.
"Dearest Princess Fiona."
"You are hereby summoned to
the Kingdom of Far, Far Away"
"for a royal ball in
celebration of your marriage"
"at which time the King"
"will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your..."
uh..."Prince Charming.
"Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away."
"Aka Mom and Dad."
Mom and Dad?
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?
- We're not going.
- What?
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...
shocked to see you like this?
Well, they might be a bit surprised.
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.
Yeah, right.
Somehow I don't think I'll be
welcome at the country club.
Stop it. They're
not like that.
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
Oh, come on! You could at
least give them a chance.
To do what? Sharpen
their pitchforks?
No! They just want to
give you their blessing.
Oh, great. Now I
need their blessing?
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!
Who says I want to be
part of this family?
You did! When you married me!
Well, there's some
fine print for you!
So that's it. You won't come?
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going!
And that's final!
Come on! We don't
want to hit traffic!
Don't worry! We'll take care of everything.
Hey, wait for me. Oof!
<i>Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head
'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!</i>
<i>Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!</i>
<i>Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!</i>
<i>Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Move 'em on! Rawhide!</i>
<i>Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea!</i>
<i>Buy 'em drinks!</i>
<i>Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!</i>
<i>Rawhide! Yee-haw!</i>
- Are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.
- Okay, are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
- Really?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!
- Are we there yet?
- No!
Are we there yet?
That's not funny. That's really immature.
This is why nobody likes ogres.
Your loss!
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!
This is taking forever, Shrek. There's
no in-flight movie or nothing!
The Kingdom of Far,
Far Away, Donkey.
That's where we're going.
Far, far...
Away!
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.
Well, find a way to
entertain yourself.
For five minutes...
Could you not be yourself...
... for five minutes!
Are we there yet?
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!
Wow!
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.
Hey, good-looking! We'll be
back to pick you up later!
<i>Gotta make a move to a
town that's right for me.</i>
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.
Halt!
<i>Well, I talk about it, talk about
it, talk about it, talk about it.</i>
Hey, everyone, look.
<i>Talk about, talk
about movin'...</i>
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.
Swimming pools! Movie stars!
Announcing the
long-awaited return
of the beautiful Princess
Fiona and her new husband.
Well, this is it.
- This is it.
- This is it.
This is it.
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.
So...
you still think this
was a good idea?
Of course! Look. Mom and
Dad look happy to see us.
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that's our little girl.
That's not little! That's
a really big problem.
Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince
Charming and break the spell?
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...
Happy now? We came.
We saw them.
Now let's go before
they light the torches.
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.
That was for my own...
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back
inside and pretend we're not home.
Harold, we have to be...
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...
A disaster! There is no way...
- You can do this.
- I really...
- Really...
- Don't... want... to... be...
Here!
Mom... Dad...
I'd like you to
meet my husband...
Shrek.
Well, um...
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.
Excuse me.
Better out than in, I
always say, eh, Fiona?
That's good.
I guess not.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.
I had the hardest time
finding this place.
No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!
No, Dad! It's all right. It's all right.
He's with us.
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: The noble steed.
Waiter! How about a
bowl for the steed?
Oh, boy.
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?
Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs. Q.
Mmm!
No, no. Darling.
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.
Well...
Shrek owns his own land.
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!
It's in an enchanted forest
abundant in squirrels and
cute little duckies and...
What?
I know you ain't talking
about the swamp.
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.
I suppose that would be a fine
place to raise the children.
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, Okay?
- For his type, yes.
- My type?
I got to go to the bathroom.
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.
<i>Bon appetit!</i>
Oh, Mexican food!
My favourite.
Let's not sit here with
our tummies rumbling.
Everybody dig in.
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.
I suppose any grandchildren I
could expect from you would be...
Ogres, yes!
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!
That is, assuming you
don't eat your own young!
Dad!
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.
Aye, day care or
dragon-guarded castle.
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!
It's so nice to have the
family together for dinner.
- Harold!
- Shrek!
- Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Mom!
- Harold...
Donkey!
<i>Your fallen tears
have called to me.</i>
<i>So, here comes
my sweet remedy.</i>
<i>I know what every
princess needs.</i>
<i>For her to live
life happily...</i>
Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you.
You're all grown up.
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!
I'm your fairy godmother.
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.
Now, don't worry. I'm here
to make it all better.
With just a...
<i>Wave of my magic wand Your
troubles will soon be gone.</i>
<i>With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash.</i>
<i>A high-priced dress
made by mice no less.</i>
<i>Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress.</i>
<i>Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse.</i>
<i>Confide in your very
own furniture friends.</i>
<i>We'll help you set a
new fashion trend.</i>
<i>- I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great.
- The kind of girl a prince would date!</i>
<i>They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...</i>
<i>"For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!"</i>
<i>A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle.</i>
<i>Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away.</i>
<i>And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!</i>
<i>Nip and tuck, here and there to land
that prince with the perfect hair.</i>
<i>Lipstick liners, shadows blush To
get that prince with the sexy tush.</i>
<i>Lucky day, hunk buffet You and your
prince take a roll in the hay.</i>
<i>You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune.</i>
<i>Don't be drab, you'll be fab Your
prince will have rock-hard abs.</i>
<i>Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!</i>
<i>Nip and tuck, here and there To land
that prince with the perfect hair.</i>
Stop!
Look...
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,
but I really don't
need all this.
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.
Fiona? Fiona?
Oh! You got a puppy? All I
got in my room was shampoo.
Oh, uh...
Fairy Godmother, furniture...
I'd like you to meet
my husband, Shrek.
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?
Shrek is the one who rescued me.
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!
She's just trying to help.
Good! She can help us pack. Get
your coat, dear. We're leaving.
- What?
- I don't want to leave.
When did you decide this?
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.
But remember, dear. If you
should ever need me...
happiness...
is just a teardrop away.
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.
Happy, happy, happy...
So I see.
Let's go, Kyle.
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?
I told you coming
here was a bad idea.
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.
I don't think I was going
to get Daddy's blessing,
even if I did want it.
Do you think it might be nice if
somebody asked me what I wanted?
Sure. Do you want
me to pack for you?
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!
Here's a news flash for you!
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"
I knew this would happen.
You should. You started it.
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.
I think, Harold, you're taking
this a little too personally.
This is Fiona's choice.
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?
Fiona does. And she'll never
forgive you if you don't.
I don't want to lose our
daughter again, Harold.
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.
Don't you remember
when we were young?
We used to walk down by
the lily pond and...
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.
It's not the same!
I don't think you realize that our
daughter has married a monster!
Oh, stop being
such a drama king.
Fine! Pretend there's
nothing wrong!
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!
I'd like to know how it
could get any worse!
Hello, Harold.
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!
Just the old hunting
wound playing up a bit!
I'll just stretch it
out here for a while.
You better get in.
We need to talk.
Actually, Fairy
Godmother, off to bed.
Already taken my pills, and
they tend to make me a bit drowsy.
So, how about... we make
this a quick visit. What?
Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha!
So, what's new?
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.
When did you get back?
Oh, about five minutes
ago, actually.
After I endured blistering
winds, scorching desert...
I climbed to the highest
room in the tallest tower...
Mommy can handle this.
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!
He climbs to the highest bloody
room of the tallest bloody tower...
And what does he find?
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess
is already married.
It wasn't my fault. He
didn't get there in time.
Stop the car!
Harold.
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.
Where are we?
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?
My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy.
Er... okay.
Two Renaissance Wraps, no Mayo...
chili rings...
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.
Your order, Fairy Godmother. This
comes with the Medieval Meal.
There you are, dear.
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you
don't want me to go back on my part.
Indeed not.
So, Fiona and Charming
will be together.
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.
Not only for your daughter...
but for your Kingdom.
What am I supposed
to do about it?
Use your imagination.
Oh...
Come on in, Your Majesty.
<i>I like my town.</i>
<i>With a little drop of poison.</i>
<i>Nobody knows...</i>
Excuse me.
Do I know you?
No, you must be mistaking
me for someone else.
Uh... excuse me. I'm looking
for the Ugly Stepsister.
Ah! There you are. Right.
You see, I need to have
someone taken care of.
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.
Um... He's an ogre.
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...
he don't like to be disturbed.
He don't like to be disturbed.
Where could I find him?
Hello?
Who dares enter my room?
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to
about an ogre problem?
You are told correct.
But for this, I charge
a great deal of money.
Would... this be enough?
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.
Just tell me where I
can find this ogre.
<i>Everyone says I'm
getting down too low.</i>
<i>Everyone says you've
just gotta let it go.</i>
<i>You just gotta let it go.</i>
<i>I need some sleep.</i>
<i>Time to put the
old horse down.</i>
<i>I'm in too deep.</i>
<i>And the wheels keep
spinning round.</i>
<i>Everyone says you've
just gotta let it go.</i>
<i>Everyone says you've
just gotta let it go.</i>
<i>Dear Knight, I pray that you take this
favour as a token of my gratitude.</i>
<i>Dear Diary...</i>
<i>Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,</i>
<i>but Dad says I can't go. He
never lets me out after sunset.</i>
<i>Dad says I'm going
away for a while.</i>
<i>Must be like some
finishing school.</i>
<i>Mom says that when
I'm old enough,</i>
<i>my Prince Charming will
rescue me from my tower</i>
<i>and bring me back
to my family,</i>
<i>and we'll all live
happily ever after.</i>
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>
Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.
No, no. I was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behaviour earlier.
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.
Do you suppose we could pretend it
never happened and start over...
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.
Dad. We both acted like ogres.
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.
A little father-son time?
I know it would mean
the world to Fiona.
Shall we say, 7:30
by the old oak?
Face it, Donkey! We're lost.
We can't be lost. We followed the
King's instructions exactly.
"Head to the darkest
part of the woods..."
"Past the sinister trees with
scary-looking branches."
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.
Oh, great. My one chance to fix
things up with Fiona's dad
and I end up lost in
the woods with you!
Don't get huffy! I'm
only trying to help.
I know! I know.
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.
Yeah, sure. Now let's
go bond with Daddy.
Well, well, well, Donkey.
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?
What? I ain't purring.
Sure. What's next? A hug?
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What
do you think I am, some kind of a...
Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare!
Look! A little cat.
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.
Come here, little
kitty, kitty.
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!
Oh, God. Oh...
No!
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!
Shrek! Hold still!
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.
Now, ye ogre, pray
for mercy from...
Puss... in Boots!
I'll kill that cat!
Ah-ha-ha!
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!
What should we do with him?
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.
<i>Oh, no! Por favor! Please!</i>
I implore you! It was
nothing personal, Señor.
I was doing it only
for my family.
My mother, she is sick. And my
father lives off the garbage!
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Fiona's father paid
you to do this?
The rich King? Sí.
Well, so much for
Dad's royal blessing.
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.
Gee, thanks.
Maybe Fiona would've been better off if
I were some sort of Prince Charming.
That's what the King said.
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that
question was directed at me.
Shrek, Fiona knows you'd
do anything for her.
Well, it's not like I
wouldn't change if I could.
I just... I just wish I
could make her happy.
Hold the phone...
"Happiness."
"A tear drop away."
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!
Aw, man, where do I begin?
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.
Then they got drunk and start beating
me with a stick, going "Piñata!"
What is a piñata, anyway?
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!
Don't go projecting on me.
I know you're feeling
bad, but you got to...
Aaaahh!
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...
<i>What? Is it on? Is it on?</i>
<i>This is Fairy Godmother.</i>
<i>I'm either away from my
desk or with a client.</i>
<i>But if you come by the office, we'll
be glad to make you an appointment.</i>
<i>Have a "happy ever after."</i>
Oh...
Are you up for a
little quest, Donkey?
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!
<i>Ain't no stoppin' us now! Wooh!
We're on the move!</i>
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.
On my honour, I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life
as you have spared me mine.
The position of annoying talking
animal has already been taken.
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...
in his wee little boots.
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?
Ahh!
Listen. He's purring!
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.
Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look
who's telling who to lighten up!
Shrek!
Shrek?
They're both festive,
aren't they?
What do you think, Harold?
Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine.
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.
Honestly, Lillian, I
don't think it matters.
How do we know there
will even be a ball?
Mom. Dad.
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
I haven't. You should
ask your father.
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...
Mmm! Exquisite. What
do you call this dish?
That would be the dog's
breakfast, Your Majesty.
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.
I'm sure he just went off
to look for a nice...
mud hole to cool down in.
You know, after your
little spat last night.
Oh. You heard that, huh?
The whole kingdom heard you.
I mean, after all, it is
in his nature to be...
well, a bit of a brute.
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.
Shrek loves me for who I am.
I would think you'd
be happy for me.
Darling, I'm just thinking
about what's best for you.
Maybe you should do the same.
No, really?
Shh...
Oh...
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.
That's the Fairy
Godmother's cottage.
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.
Then why don't we pop in there for a spell?
Ha-ha! Spell!
He makes me laugh.
Hi. I'm here to see the...
The Fairy Godmother. I'm sorry.
She is not in.
<i>Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo.
Now!</i>
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, Okay?
That's Okay, buddy.
We're from the union.
The union?
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.
Oh! Oh, right.
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?
Uh... a little. We don't
even have dental.
They don't even have dental.
Okay, we'll just
have a look around.
Oh. By the way.
I think it'd be better if the Fairy
Godmother didn't know we were here.
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.
A drop of desire.
Naughty!
A pinch of passion.
And just a hint of...
lust!
Excuse me.
Sorry to barge in like this...
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?
Well, it seems that Fiona's
not exactly happy.
Oh-ho-ho!
And there's some question
as to why that is?
Well, let's explore
that, shall we?
Ah. P, P, P. Princess.
Cinderella.
Here we are. "Lived happily
ever after." Oh...
No ogres!
Let's see. Snow White.
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.
The Golden Bird, the Little
Mermaid, Pretty Woman...
No, no, no, no, no!
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.
All right, look, lady!
Don't you point... those
dirty green sausages at me!
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.
Oh! Sorry.
Ah... that's okay.
We were just leaving.
Very sorry to have wasted
your time, Miss Godmother.
Just... go.
Come on, guys.
TGIF, eh, buddy?
Working hard or hardly
working, eh, Mac?
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!
Man, that stinks!
You don't exactly smell
like a basket of roses.
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!
Already our minds
are becoming one.
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.
Shrek, this is a bad idea.
Look. Make yourself
useful and go keep watch.
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?
No problema, boss. In
one of my nine lives,
I was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Shrek, are you off your nut?
Donkey, keep watch.
Keep watch? Yeah,
I'll keep watch.
I'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.
I'll laugh, too. I'll
be giggling to myself.
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect
solution for marital problems.
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try "handsome."
Sorry. No handsome.
Hey! How about
"Happily Ever After"?
Well, what does it do?
It says "Beauty Divine."
In some cultures, donkeys are
revered as the wisest of creatures.
Especially us talking ones.
Donkey!
That'll have to do.
We've got company.
Can we get on with this?
Hurry!
Nice catch, Donkey!
Finally! A good use
for your mouth.
Come on!
<i>You spurn my natural emotions.</i>
<i>You make me feel like
dirt and I'm hurt.</i>
<i>And if I start a commotion.</i>
<i>I run the risk of losing
you and that's worse.</i>
<i>Ever fallen in love with
someone, ever fallen in love.</i>
<i>In love with someone,
ever fallen in love.</i>
<i>In love with someone you shouldn't
have fallen in love with.</i>
<i>Ever fallen in love with
someone, ever fallen in love.</i>
<i>In love with someone,
ever fallen in love.</i>
<i>With someone you shouldn't
have fallen in love with.</i>
<i>Fallen in love with.</i>
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone you
shouldn't have fallen in love with</i>
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!
And somebody bring me something deep
fried and smothered in chocolate!
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.
Whoa, what happened here?
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders!
I will smite him
where he stands!
He will rue the very day he
stole my kingdom from me!
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.
Pardon. Um...
Everything is accounted for, Fairy
Godmother, except for one potion.
What?
Oh...
I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength."
"For you and your true love."
"If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine."
"Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine."
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.
Hey, man, this don't feel right. My
donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o' voodoo and
let's get out of here.
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapo Rub over your chest, think again!
Boss, just in case there is
something wrong with the potion...
allow me to take the first sip.
It would be an honour to lay
my life on the line for you.
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.
If there'll be any animal
testing, I'll do it.
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.
How do you feel?
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?
You still look
like an ass to me.
Maybe it doesn't
work on donkeys.
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!
But I love Fiona more.
But I love Fiona more.
Shrek, no! Wait!
Got to be... I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.
Maybe it's a dud.
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
I don't want to die!
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!
I'm melting!
It's just the rain, Donkey.
Oh.
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy
and Fiona's father hired a
sleazy hitman to whack you.
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...
<i>The sun'll come out...</i>
<i>Tomorrow</i>
<i>Bet your bottom...</i>
Bet my bottom?
I'm coming, Elizabeth!
Donkey?
Are you all right?
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?
There you are! We
missed you at dinner.
What is it, darling?
Dad...
I've been thinking
about what you said.
And I'm going to
set things right.
Ah! Excellent! That's my girl.
It was a mistake to
bring Shrek here.
I'm going to go
out and find him.
And then we'll go back to
the swamp where we belong.
Fiona, please!
Let's not be rash, darling. You
can't go anywhere right now.
Fiona!
Look, I told you he was here. Look at him!
Quiet. Look at him.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Good morning!
We love your kitty!
- Oh... My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.
Thanks.
Uhh!
Aahh!
Oh...
A cute button nose?
Thick, wavy locks?
Taut, round buttocks?
I'm... I'm...
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.
I'm Jill. What's your name?
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.
Get in line.
Get in line.
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!
I can whinny.
I can count.
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."
Pah!
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping."
"Not intended for heart
patients or those with...
nervous disorders."
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place!
Yeah!
What?
Señor? "To make the effects
of this potion permanent",
"the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight."
Midnight? Why is it
always midnight?
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.
I'll be true... enough.
Look, ladies, I already
have a true love.
Oh...
And take it from me, Boss.
You are going to have
one satisfied princess.
And let's face it. You are
a lot easier on the eyes.
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...
- Easy.
- Cantankerous, foul,
angry ogre you always been.
And you're still the
same annoying donkey.
Yeah.
Well...
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.
First things first.
We need to get you out of those clothes.
- Ready?
- Ready!
Driver, stop!
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!
I'm blind! Tell the truth.
Will I ever play
the violin again?
You poor creature!
Is there anything
I can do for you?
Well, I guess there
is one thing.
Take off the powdered wig and
step away from your drawers.
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.
Father? Is everything
all right, Father?
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.
Unless, of course, I can't
find you or if I forget.
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn
and face the strange.</i>
<i>Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>
<i>Don't wanna be a richer one.</i>
<i>Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>
<i>Turn and face the strange.</i>
<i>Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>
<i>Just gonna have to
be a different man.</i>
<i>Time may change me.</i>
<i>But I can't trace time.</i>
Halt!
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.
<i>Still don't know what
I was looking for.</i>
<i>And my time was running wild,
a million dead-end streets.</i>
<i>Every time I thought
I'd got it made.</i>
<i>It seemed the taste
was not so sweet</i>
<i>Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>
<i>Turn and face the strange.</i>
<i>- Shrek?
- Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>
<i>Don't wanna be a richer one.</i>
<i>Time may change me.</i>
<i>But I can't trace time</i>
Fiona?
Hello, handsome.
Shrek!
- Princess!
- Donkey?
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?
What potion?
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...
Now, we're sexy!
Shrek?
For you, baby... I could be.
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?
He went inside looking for you.
Shrek?
Fiona! Fiona!
You want to dance, pretty boy?
Are you going so soon? Don't
you want to see your wife?
Fiona?
Shrek?
Aye, Fiona. It is me.
What happened to your voice?
The potion changed a
lot of things, Fiona.
But not the way I
feel about you.
Fiona?
- Charming?
- Do you think so?
Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve.
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.
I know you never get a second
chance at a first impression,
but, well, what do you think?
Fiona! Fiona!
Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!
Oh, shoot! I don't think
they can hear us, pigeon.
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?
I just wanted her to be happy.
And now she can be.
Oh, sweetheart.
She's finally found the
prince of her dreams.
But look at me. Look
what I've done for her.
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.
But...
I love her.
If you really love her...
you'll let her go.
Shrek?
Señor.
What's going on?
Where are you going?
You wouldn't have had anything to
do with this, would you, Harold?
<i>People just ain't no good.</i>
<i>I think that's
well understood.</i>
There you go, boys.
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
Hey. Why the long face?
It was all just a
stupid mistake.
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.
I hate Mondays.
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.
What choice do I have?
She loves that pretty
boy, Prince Charming.
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.
Look, guys. It's for the best.
Mom and Dad approve,
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.
Everybody wins.
Except for you.
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.
Aye.
And that's why I
have to let her go.
Excuse me, is she here?
She's, uh... in the back.
Oh, hello again.
Fairy Godmother. Charming.
You'd better have a good reason for
dragging us down here, Harold.
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.
I mean, how charming can I be
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?
No, no, it's nobody's fault.
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!
I beg to differ. I
do it all the time!
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall
in love with the first man she kisses,
which will be Charming.
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?
I can't. I won't do it.
Oh, yes, you will.
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.
And I can take it
away just as easily.
Is that what you want? Is it?
- No.
- Good boy.
Now, we have to go.
I need to do Charming's
hair before the ball.
He's hopeless. He's all
high in the front.
He can never get to the back. You
need someone to do the back.
Oh. Thank you, Mother.
Mother?
Um... Mary! A talking horse!
The ogre!
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!
<i>The abs are fab and it's gluteus
to the maximus</i>
<i>here at tonight's Far, Far
Away Royal Ball blowout!</i>
<i>The coaches are lined up as the
cream of the crop pours out of them</i>
<i>like Miss Muffet's
curds and whey.</i>
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out
to honour Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.
And, oh my, the outfits
look gorgeous!
Look! Hansel and Gretel!
What the heck are
the crumbs for?
And right behind them, Tom
Thumb and Thumbelina!
Oh, aren't they adorable!
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!
Tired old thing.
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?
Oh. It's the one,
it's the only...
It's the Fairy Godmother!
Hello, Far, Far Away!
Can I get a whoop whoop?
May all your endings
be happy and...
Well, you know the rest!
<i>We'll be right back with the
Royal Far, Far Away Ball</i>
<i>after these messages.</i>
I hate these ball shows.
They bore me to tears. Flip
over to Wheel Of Torture!
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.
Whizzes on you guys.
Hey, mice, pass me
a buffalo wing!
No, to your left. Your left!
<i>- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!</i>
<i>We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.</i>
<i>It's time to teach
these madcap mammals</i>
<i>their "devil may mare"
attitudes just won't fly.</i>
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!
I have to talk to
Princess Fiona!
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!
<i>Did someone let the
cat out of the bag?</i>
You capitalist pig dogs!
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.
Find Princess Fiona!
I'm a donkey!
Tell her Shrek... I'm
her husband, Shrek!
Quick! Rewind it!
I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!
Darling?
Ah. I thought I might
find you here.
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?
I'm not going.
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.
I mean, look at him.
Yes, he is a bit different,
but people change for
the ones they love.
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.
Change?
He's completely lost his mind!
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?
You might find you
like this new Shrek.
But it's the old one I
fell in love with, Dad.
I'd give anything
to have him back.
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.
Otherwise I'm up all night.
Thanks.
I got to get out of here!
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!
What about my Miranda rights?
You're supposed to say I have
the right to remain silent.
Nobody said I have the
right to remain silent!
You have the right
to remain silent.
What you lack is the capacity.
I must hold on before
I, too, go totally mad.
Shrek? Donkey?
Too late.
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!
Oh...
Fire in ze hole!
Look out below!
Quick! Tell a lie!
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!
Say something crazy like "I'm
wearing ladies' underwear!"
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!
It looks like you most
certainly am are!
- I am not!
- What kind?
- It's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!
- Are not.
- Are too!
- Are not!
- Are too!
Here we go. Hang tight.
Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!
Ow!
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!
We've got to stop that kiss!
I thought you was
going to let her go.
I was, but I can't let
them do this to Fiona.
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.
The castle's guarded. There's
a moat and everything!
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?
Well, sure! He's down
on Drury Lane. Why?
Because we're gonna need flour.
Lots and lots of flour.
Gingy!
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!
It's alive!
Run, run, run, as fast you can!
Go, baby, go!
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!
That's right! Follow
the pretty pony!
Pretty pony wants to
play at the castle!
Pretty pony.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Presenting Princess Fiona and
her new husband, Prince Shrek.
Shrek, what are you doing?
I'm just playing
the part, Fiona.
Is that glitter on your lips?
Mm. Cherry flavoured.
Want to taste?
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...
C Minor, put it in C Minor.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to dedicate
this song to...
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
Fiona, my Princess.
Will you honour me with a dance?
<i>Where have all the
good men gone.</i>
<i>And where are all the gods?</i>
Dance!
<i>Where's the
streetwise Hercules.</i>
<i>To fight the rising odds?</i>
Since when do you dance?
Fiona, my dearest, if
there's one thing I know,
it's that love is
full of surprises.
<i>Late at night I
toss and I turn.</i>
<i>And I dream of what I need.</i>
Hit it!
<i>I need a hero.</i>
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!
Man the catapults!
Aim! Fire!
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!
Not the gumdrop button!
Incoming!
Ha-ha! All right!
<i>Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy.</i>
Go, Mongo! Go!
Man the cauldrons!
After you, Mongo.
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!
Shrek!
More heat, less foam!
<i>Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above.</i>
<i>Out where the lightning
Splits the sea.</i>
<i>I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me.</i>
Heave! Ho!
Come on!
Look out!
Be good.
He needs me! Let me go!
Donkey!
Puss!
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!
Today, I repay my debt.
Aww...
<i>En garde!</i>
<i>He's gotta be strong And
he's gotta be fast.</i>
<i>And he's gotta be
fresh From the fight.</i>
<i>- I need a hero.
- Stop!</i>
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?
You couldn't just go back to your
swamp and leave well enough alone.
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!
Pinocchio! Get the wand!
I see London! I see France!
Whah!
I'm a real boy!
Ah! Ah! Aaahh!
Catch!
Donkey!
Oh!
I'm a real boy. Aah!
Oh!
- Ha!
- Ah.
That's mine!
Pray for mercy, from Puss...
And Donkey!
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!
No!
Hi-ya!
- Fiona.
- Shrek.
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!
Well, I guess I gave
her the wrong tea.
- Mommy!
- Mommy?
I told you.
Ogres don't live
happily ever after.
Woo!
Ha!
Oh, Dad!
- Is he?
- Yup.
He croaked.
Harold?
Dad?
I'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!
No, no, he's right. I'm sorry.
To both of you.
I only wanted what
was best for Fiona.
But I can see now...
she already has it.
Shrek, Fiona...
Will you accept an old
frog's apologies...
and my blessing?
Harold? I'm sorry, Lillian.
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.
You're more that man today
than you ever were...
warts and all.
Boss! The Happily
Ever After Potion!
Midnight!
Fiona. Is this what you want?
To be this way forever?
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...
we can stay like this.
You'd do that?
- For me?
- Yes.
I want what any princess wants.
To live happily ever after...
with the ogre I married.
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
Whoa!
No. No, no. Aaah! Ow.
Oh, no.
Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.
Now, where were we?
Oh. I remember.
Hey! Isn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?
<i>Uno, dos, cuatro, hit it!</i>
Puss and Donkey, y'all...
<i>She's into superstitions.</i>
<i>Black cats and voodoo dolls.</i>
<i>- Sing it, Puss!
- I feel a premonition.</i>
<i>That girl's gonna
make me fall.</i>
Here we go!
<i>She's into new sensations.</i>
<i>New kicks in the candlelight.</i>
<i>She's got a new addiction.</i>
<i>For every day and night.</i>
<i>She'll make you take
your clothes off.</i>
<i>And go dancing in the rain.</i>
<i>She'll make you live
her crazy life.</i>
<i>But she'll take
away your pain.</i>
<i>Like a bullet to your brain.</i>
<i>Upside inside out.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
Hey gorgeous!
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>Her lips are devil red.</i>
<i>And her skin's the
colour of mocha.</i>
<i>She will wear you out.</i>
<i>- Living la vida loca.
- She livin' it loca!</i>
<i>Living la vida loca</i>
<i>- Say it one more time now!
- Living the vida loca</i>
Hey, Donkey, that's Spanish!
<i>She'll push and pull you down.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>She will wear you out.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>She'll push and pull you down.</i>
<i>Living the vida loca.</i>
<i>Her lips are devil red.</i>
<i>And her skin's the
colour of mocha.</i>
<i>She will wear you out.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>
<i>All by myself.</i>
<i>All by myself.</i>
<i>Don't wanna be.</i>
<i>All by myself anymore...</i>
Amigo, we are off to
the Kit-Kat Club.
Come on, join us.
Thanks, compadre. I'm...
I'm not in the mood.
<i>We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!</i>
Hey, baby!
Hey, that's my girl!
Yeah! All right!
Baby, where you been?
I'm sorry, too.
I should've stayed. But Shrek
had this thing he had to do.
What? Say it one more time.
What you talking about?
Are you serious?
Papa!
Look at our little
mutant babies!
