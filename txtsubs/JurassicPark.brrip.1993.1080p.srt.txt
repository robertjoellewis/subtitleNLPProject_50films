<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everybody, heads up!
- Keep it clear, now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep it clear!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it forward,
come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow it down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushing team, move in there.
Move in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On your ready.
I want Tasers on full charge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Steady!
- Go on. Step back in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready. Move it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And push.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Locked. Loading team,
step away.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jophery, raise the gate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Block the opening!
- Don't let her get out!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody help him!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Work her back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot her!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard that Hammond's
not even here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sends his apologies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had to leave early, his
daughter's getting a divorce.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, but we need to
deal with the situation now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The insurance company...
You okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That makes the investors
very anxious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to promise to conduct a very
thorough, on-site inspection.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to or they'll
pull the funding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'll slow him down
even more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If two experts sign off
on the island,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the insurance guys
will back off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want Alan Grant.
Grant?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never get him
out of Montana.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because Grant's like me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a digger.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate computers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The feeling's mutual.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it work?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long
does this take?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should bring
an immediate return.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shoot the radar
into the ground,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the bone bounces
the image back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bounces it back...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This new program
is incredible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few more years' development, and
we won't even have to dig any more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the fun in that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Post-mortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Velociraptor?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Good shape, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 5, 6 feet high.
I'm guessing 9 feet long.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look...
What'd you do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He touched it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant's not
machine-compatible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, they've got it
in for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrists.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, seriously.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
present-day birds than with reptiles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, like a bird.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even the word "Raptor"
means "bird of prey."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't
look very scary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More like a 6-foot turkey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A turkey?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine yourself in
the Cretaceous period.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no, not Velociraptor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stare at him and he
just stares right back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's when
the attack comes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not from the front,
but from the side.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the other two Raptors you
didn't even know were there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He uses coordinated
attack patterns</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he is out
in force today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he slashes at you
with this,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a 6-inch retractable claw, like
a razor, on the middle toe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion. No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He slashes at you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">here or here...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you know, try to
show a little respect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you could've pulled
a gun on him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know. Kids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to have
one of those?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want that kid,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a breed of the child
could be intriguing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what's so
wrong with kids?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheap, cheap.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't smell!
Some smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a break!
Babies smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to shut down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut the machine!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cover it all up.
- Pull it over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just cut it, will you?
Shut it down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were saving that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For today, I guarantee it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who in God's name
do you think you are?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John Hammond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I can see that my $50,000
a year has been well spent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the jerk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our paleobotanist,
Dr...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sattler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance, Dr.
Sattler, but...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have this.
I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's samples
all over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know my way
around the kitchen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'll get right
to the point.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like you.
Both of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can tell instantly
about people. It's a gift.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I own an island off the
coast of Costa Rica.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've leased it from the government
and during the last 5 years,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been setting up
a biological preserve.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what are those?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small versions of
adults, honey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not just kids, everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to open next year, if
the lawyers don't kill me first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care for lawyers,
do you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't really know any.
Don't really know any.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do, there's a particular pebble in
my shoe, who represents my investors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says that they insist
on outside opinions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of opinions?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, your kind, not to put
too fine a point on it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's face it, in your particular
fields, you're the top minds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I could just
persuade you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would they care
what we think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of park
is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right up your alley.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you come down, just the
pair of you, for the weekend?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
This isn't possible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just dug up
a new skeleton...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a very unusual time.
The timing is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for a further
3 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the plane?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
3 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dodgson!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't use my name.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dodgson. We've got
Dodgson here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, nobody cares.
Nice hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you trying to look
like, a secret agent?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well?
$750,000.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's $1.5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get them all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I supposed
to transport them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bottom screws open.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great.
Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys.
That's great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Customs can even check it
if they want to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see.
Go on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's enough coolant
for 36 hours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No menthol?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The embryos have to be back
here in San Jose by then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's up to your guy
on the boat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock.
Make sure he gets it right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you planning
to beat security?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got
an 18-minute window.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18 minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get cheap on me,
Dodgson.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was Hammond's mistake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you two
dig up dinosaurs?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...
We try to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to get
used to Dr. Malcolm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">especially for
a mathematician.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chaotician. Chaotician,
actually.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John doesn't subscribe
to chaos,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">particularly what it says
about his science project.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of the behavior
of the system in phase space?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No? Non-linear equations?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange attractors?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I refuse to believe that you aren't
familiar with the concept of attraction.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bring scientists.
You bring a rock star.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad wind shears.
We have to drop pretty fast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, this will
be thrilling.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you need that piece over
here, and that piece...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the concrete moats, and the
motion-sensor tracking systems.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">48 hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll shut you down, John.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 48 hours, I'll be
accepting your apologies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, slow down.
Slow. Stop!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This shouldn't be here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan, this species of
Veriforman has been extinct</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dinosaur.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did it. Crazy son
of a bitch, you did it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could tear up the rule book on
cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're wrong. This is
a warm-blooded creature.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing doesn't
live in a swamp.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing's got
a 25, 27-foot neck?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Brachiosaurus? 30.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna make
a fortune with this place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How fast are they?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we clocked the T-Rex
at 32 miles an hour.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-Rex?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you've got a T-Rex?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a T-Rex.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your head
between your knees.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my dear Dr. Sattler,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">welcome to Jurassic Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're moving in herds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They do move in herds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">incorporating all
the latest technologies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are you thinking?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That we're out of a job.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you mean "extinct"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here he comes.
Well, here I come.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, John.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I've got lines.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That hurt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax, John. It's all part
of the miracle of cloning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, John.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cloned from what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loy extractions never recreated
an intact DNA strand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without massive
sequence gaps.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paleo-DNA,
from what source?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Mr. DNA,
where did you come from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From your blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of DNA,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the building blocks of life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A DNA strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And just like today, they fed
on the blood of animals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After a long time, the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Using sophisticated
techniques,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they extract
the preserved blood</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the mosquito,
Dino DNA!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A full DNA strand contains
3 billion genetic codes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we looked at screens like these
once a second for 8 hours a day,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it'd take 2 years to look
at the entire DNA strand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that's where our
geneticists take over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">break down the strand
in minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And virtual-reality displays</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We used the complete
DNA of a frog</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to fill in the holes
and complete the code.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This score
is only temporary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It all has very dramatic
music, of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then, the tour moves on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, look here.
- Those hard-working cowpokes you see behind us...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is overwhelming, John.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are these characters
autoerotica?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we have no
animatronics here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those people are the real miracle
workers of Jurassic Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't we see
the unfertilized eggs?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shortly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you stop
these things?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
It's kind of a ride.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't do that.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can they do that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boat
for the mainland</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be leaving at 1900.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day, Henry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's turning the eggs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, why
didn't you tell me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I insist on being here
when they're born.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, little one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good. Push.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Very good.
- God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.
Helps them to trust me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually they can't
breed in the wild.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Population control is one
of our security precautions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know
they can't breed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've engineered them
that way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God.
- Look at that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood temperature seems
like about high 80s, maybe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wu?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">91.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Homoeothermic?
It holds that temperature?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, again, how do you know
they're all female?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make them male.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We simply deny them that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deny them that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, the kind of control you're
attempting is not possible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's that life will
not be contained.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life breaks free.
Expands to new territories</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What species is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Velociraptor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bred Raptors?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
What are they doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feeding them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu for us.
Chilean sea bass, I believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They should all be destroyed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bit of an alarmist, but knows
more about Raptors than anyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's their growth rate?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're lethal at
8 months, and I do mean lethal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've hunted most things that can
hunt you, but the way these move...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fast for a biped?
Cheetah speed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50, 60 miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're
astonishing jumpers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They show extreme
intelligence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even problem-solving
intelligence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially the big one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We bred 8 originally,
but when she came in,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one, when she looks at you, you
can see she's working things out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we have to
feed them like this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fences are electrified,
right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were testing the fences for
weaknesses, systematically.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They remember.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Well, who's hungry?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More adventurous guests,
of course,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can opt for our
jungle river cruise</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or for a close-up look
at our majestic...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of these attractions are
ready yet, but the park will open</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 or 12 months
after that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely spectacular
designs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spared no expense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we can charge
anything we want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's
the merchandise...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donald.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure. They will.
We'll have a coupon day or something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.
They're a lot worse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, wait a second, we haven't
even seen the park yet...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I may.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you don't take
any responsibility for it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something as fast
as you could.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to sell it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they didn't stop to
think if they should.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wouldn't have
anything to say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by deforestation or
the building of a dam.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's so great
about discovery?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a violent,
penetrative act,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call the rape of
the natural world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have poisonous plants
in this building.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You picked them
because they look good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 species separated by 65 million years of evolution</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spend a little time
with our target audience.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grandpa!
- Kids!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Careful with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We missed you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We loved the presents.
They were great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you enjoy
the helicopter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, kids, come away.
- Not too close to the cars.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These will be your transports
for the afternoon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No drivers?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No drivers.
They're electric.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Totally non-polluting.
Top of the line. Spared no expense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an interactive CD-ROM!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant, come in
the second car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna ride
with Dr. Sattler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read your book.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few species may have
evolved along those lines.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard that there
was this meteor,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, which car
were you planning on?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whichever one you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They died because
of the weather.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boat is now loading.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about 75 miles west of us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I build
in Orlando?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ray, start the tour program.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold onto your butts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why did they put
the fiberglass thing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to
join the future, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God help us when
the hands of engineers...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During your tour,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the appropriate
information will be</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">automatically selected
and displayed for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we gonna hit that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Jurassic Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have they got
in there, King Kong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We spared no expense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you look to the right,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dilophosaurus!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the earliest
carnivores,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This makes Dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to Jurassic Park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those shouldn't be running
off of car batteries.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Item 151 on
today's glitch list.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dennis, our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am totally unappreciated
in my time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to 3 days.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know anybody who can
network 8 machines</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and de-bug 2 million lines of code on my salary?
If so, I want to see them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about your financial problems, I really am.
But they are your problems.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really will not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's been hardly
any debate at all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't blame people
for their mistakes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do ask that
they pay for them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Dad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The headlights.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll eat a lot of
compute cycles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll lose part
of the system.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet, all of you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dinosaurs eat man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Woman inherits the earth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
- Keep watching the fence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going to happen
to the goat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to eat the goat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I happen to be a vegetarian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello. Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really hate that man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any
set patterns or park schedules.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The essence of chaos.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still not
clear on chaos.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shorthand is
the Butterfly Effect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was I going too fast?
I missed it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did a fly-by.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should be still.
The car's bouncing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's okay.
It's just an example.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A drop of water falls
on your hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thumb, I'd say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze your hand.
Don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do the same thing, start
with the same place again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way, now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's say back
the same way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It changed. Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because tiny variations,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan, look at this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The amount of blood distending your
vessels, imperfections in the skin...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"imperfections in the skin"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just microscopic,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unpredictability.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. Look at this.
See? I'm right again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody could predict that Dr.
Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's another example.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, here I am now by myself, talking to myself.
That's Chaos Theory.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop the program.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on.
Will notify for resume.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll switch it
over to TelePrompTer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about
the circuit integrities?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screen says faulty sensor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll call security.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're at full go
on that and it looks good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said, there's this other
book by a guy named Bakker</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we going?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't say
they turned into birds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
Yours was fully illustrated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.
Wait. Watch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Watch this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody stay here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't be scared.
- Come on, it's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Muldoon tranquillized her
for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's sick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, baby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was always my favorite
when I was a kid</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now I see she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Microvesicles.
That's interesting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.
What are her symptoms?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems to happen
every 6 weeks or so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 weeks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are dilated.
They are?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be damned.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this West Indian lilac?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. We know they're toxic, but
the animals don't eat them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one way
to be positive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dino droppings?
Droppings?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have to
cut the tour short.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll pick it up
again tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure we have to?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not worth
taking the chance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sustained winds at 45 knots.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them when they get
back in the cars.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in 5 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop what you're doing
and leave now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is one
big pile of shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's so odd, though.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, she's suffering
from Melia toxicity</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every 6 weeks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see, rats.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's tenacious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to stay with Dr.
Harding and finish up with the Trike.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll drop her off at the
center before I make the boat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. Then I'll catch
up with you later.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we got to go, we got to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to
give me the time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No promises.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So much for our first tour.
2 no-shows and one sick Triceratops.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could've been worse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot worse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had only sweets and I'm
gonna get something salty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I finished
debugging the phones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was going to, so I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should tell you the system
will be compiling</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you got any kids?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? Hell, yeah.
Three. I love kids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything at all can
and does happen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same with wives,
for that matter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're married?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Occasionally.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5, 4, 3,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2, 1.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's odd.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Door security systems
are shutting down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, Dr. Sattler,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's not available,
is she?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. You two are...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd I touch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't touch anything.
We stopped.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fences are failing
all over the park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find Nedry. Check
the vending machines.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look at this
work station.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a complete slob.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Raptor fences
aren't out, are they?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. They're still on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Access main program.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Access main security.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Access main program grid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't say
the magic word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please! God damn it.
I hate this hacker crap.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phone Nedry's
people in Cambridge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phones are out, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did the vehicles stop?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their radio's out, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gennaro said to stay put.
Kids okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids get scared.
What's scary?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I'm not scared.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say
you were scared.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where did
you find those?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the box, under my seat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they heavy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Then they're expensive.
Put them back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't scare me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool. Night vision.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you feel that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the goat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does he think
he's going?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you got to go,
you got to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate being
right all the time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn the light off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn the light off!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry! Turn it off!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one
who turned it...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ian, freeze!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the kids!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of the flare!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the kids!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of the flare!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hail Mary,
full of grace...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm stuck.
The seat's got my feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get you next.
You're okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, you're choking me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab the wire.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this next entry. It's the kicker.
"White rabbit object."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It did it all.
With the keychecks off,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the computer didn't
file the keystrokes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The way to find them is to check the
computer's lines of code one by one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many lines of
code are there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About 2 million.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 million?
Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring back
my grandchildren.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going with him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get Jurassic Park back
online without Dennis Nedry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should have been
there by now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the road!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Winch this sucker off the thing and
then I tie it to that thing there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My glasses. I can
afford more glasses!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's nice.
I've got to go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice dinosaur.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on. Play fetch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, stick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at stick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy.
Look at the stick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like the stick?
Go on and get it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No wonder you're extinct.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Timmy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Lex. Listen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, I'm right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay right here
and wait for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not what
I'm going to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me?
I'm coming up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate climbing.
I hate trees, way too high.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I threw up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give me your hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, I've got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good.
Over the rail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't pull me too hard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stand on the door.
- Hang on to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
Yes, it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
Yeah, me, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is impossible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I going to do this?
It's about...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to help you
with your footing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, Tim, go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster, Tim!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, jump!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, Tim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're back
in the car again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least
you're out of the tree.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the other car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this was Gennaro.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this was, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's ahead of us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could be anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With fences down, it can wander in
and out of any paddock it likes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we chance moving him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please chance it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the other car!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Grant?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody hear that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an impact tremor,
is what it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fairly alarmed here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now! Right now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must go faster.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it comes!
Stand on it! Fifth gear!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off the stick!
Bloody move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think they'll have
that on the tour?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you hearing this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Tim.
- Hurry up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get up this tree.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate trees.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't bother me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Well, you weren't
in the last one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're singing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let the monsters
come over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate the other kind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just do what they do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you and Ellie going to do now,
if you don't dig up bones any more?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we'll just
have to evolve, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you call
a blind dinosaur?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Do-you-think-he-saurus."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you call
a blind dinosaur's dog?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A "Do-you-think
He-saurus rex."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if the dinosaurs come
back while we're all asleep?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll stay awake.
All night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were all melting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll be fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the first</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really quite wonderful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a wee trapeze
and a</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">carousel</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a seesaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all move motorized,
of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Can't you see the fleas?"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With this place,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something that was real.
Something that they could</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">see and touch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An aim not
devoid of merit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're absolutely right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're over-dependent on
automation, I can see that now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time,
everything's correctable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Creation is an act
of sheer will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time,
it'll be flawless.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we have control...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've never had control!
That's the illusion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a mistake, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't have enough respect for
that power, and it's out now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing that matters
now are the people we love.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan and Lex and Tim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, they're out there,
where people are dying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spared no expense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go away!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.
It's a Brachiosaurus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Veggie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on, girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, baby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not letting go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like
it has a cold.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Maybe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I touch it?
Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just think of it
as kind of a big cow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like cows.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God bless you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yuck.
- Great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now she'll never
try anything new.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll sit in her room, never
come out, play on her computer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a hacker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I said.
You're a nerd.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not
a computer nerd.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prefer to be
called a hacker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what this is?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dinosaur egg.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dinosaurs are breeding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amphibian DNA.
What's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, on the tour,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They mutated the dinosaur
genetic code</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and blended it with
that of frogs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a single sex environment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Malcolm was right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life found a way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. That's crazy.
- You're out of your mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's absolutely
out of his mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.
What exactly would this mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're talking about
a calculated risk,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is the only
option left to us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, shutting down
the entire system...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get somebody else.
I won't do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on their original
start-up mode. Correct?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theoretically, yes. We've never
shut down the entire system before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may not come back on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would we get
the phones back?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, again, in theory.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about
the lysine contingency?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could put
that into effect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's absolutely out
of the question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if they ever get
off the island.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless they're supplied with lysine
by us, they slip into a coma and die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are dying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you please shut
down the system?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on to your butts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, see that?
It's on. It worked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn them back on,
reboot a few systems:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Telephones, security doors, half
dozen others, but it worked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">System's ready.
Where are the breakers?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maintenance shed
at the end of the compound.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 minutes, I'll have the
power back on in the park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until Mr. Arnold returns, and the
whole system's running again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tired.
I'm dirty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking at the map, I'd say the
visitor's center is just a mile</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over that rise there.
Just keep...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, can you tell me
what they are?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gallimimus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are those meat-eating?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Meat-asauruses"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're flocking this way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look how it eats.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you'll never look at
birds the same way again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.
Go now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Keep low
and follow me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look how much blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God. Something went wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something's happened.
Something's wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is just a delay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the pirates don't
eat tourists.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wait any more.
Something's wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go get
the power back on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just stroll
down the road, you know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, it's only been gone...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going with you.
Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this isn't going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it ought to be me,
really, going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a... And you're a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.
Come on, let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shutdown must've
turned off all the fences.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, this way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see the shed
from here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can make it if we run.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we're being hunted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the bushes,
straight ahead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like hell it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run. Towards the shed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Arnold?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, I'm in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Going down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have her follow
the main cable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how to read
a schematic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess that means
the power's off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not funny.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe we, we could...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it. Dead end.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look above you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Following the piping.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you give me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Respect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, guys,
it's not a race.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see the box.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says, "High Voltage."
Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Here we go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over the top.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find your footing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't throw
the main switch by hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's large, flat, and gray.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
here I go. Okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One, two, three, four.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, charged.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which says "Push to Close."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push to close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Push it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Switch them on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to jump.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what Dr. Grant says!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go.
I'll count to 3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4. 5.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming up to get you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to get Tim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm gonna
count to 3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not breathing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're back
in business!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clever girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Tim!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm gonna have
to find the others.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get you to a doctor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lex, you look after Tim.
Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your hair is
all sticking up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big Tim, the human
piece of toast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back soon.
I promise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the two Raptors, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure the third
one's contained?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Velociraptor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's inside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Control room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can
call for help?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got to reboot
the system first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The door locks!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, boot up
the door locks!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, boot up
the door locks!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Boot up
the door locks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't hold it
by yourself!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a UNIX system.
I know this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all the files
of the whole park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try to reach the gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get it
unless I move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it. This might
be the right file.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it!
Yes!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What works?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All security systems
are enabled. We got it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Hammond,
the phones are working.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The children all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The children are fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call the mainland.
Tell them to send the damn helicopters.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna cut
through the glass!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tim, let go. Yeah!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After careful consideration, I've
decided not to endorse your park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So have I.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
