<font face="Comic Sans MS">I killed Sirius Black!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The police are
continuing with the investigation...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">... into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The surrounding area remains closed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Harry Potter."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Harry Potter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bit of a tosser, really.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Funny, that paper of yours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, I was wondering...
- 11. That's when I get off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been reckless this summer, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like riding around on trains.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Takes my mind off things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now is not the time to tell it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take my arm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do as I say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just Apparated, didn't I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people vomit the first time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't imagine why.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wands out, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horace?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horace?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merlin's beard!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to disfigure me, Albus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dragon's blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Horace Slughorn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horace...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...well, you know who this is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with all the theatrics, Horace?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what that's like?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was fun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're very like your father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right at the front.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All mine. Each and every one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ex-students, I mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...on the news of the day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Free tickets whenever I want them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regulus Black.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a shame. Talented boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horace?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind if I take this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have considered it
a personal triumph...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, bye-bye, Horace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. I'll do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are indeed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, exactly what was all that about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would be his crowning jewel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both are waiting for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hedwig.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mum?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ginny, what is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was only wondering
when Harry got here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's wandering about the house.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Really.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a lovely surprise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then, what would we do
without him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a bit of toothpaste.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So when did you get here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few days ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mum sort of lost it last week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That it's too dangerous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and it took a few days,
but she came around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's been a lot of talk recently that...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Dumbledore's got a bit old.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rubbish! Well, he's only...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">150?
Give or take a few years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Dark Lord trusts him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run along, Wormtail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I ought not to be here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Dark Lord told you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your sister doubts me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't doubt you, Severus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's just a boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Severus.
- Swear to it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make the Unbreakable Vow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just empty words.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll give it his best effort.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when it matters most...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...he'll just slither back into his hole.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coward.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take out your wand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Severus Snape...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...watch over Draco Malfoy...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And will you,
to the best of your ability...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...protect him from harm?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if Draco should fail...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...will you yourself carry out the deed...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nosebleed Nougats!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will have order!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really hate children. I will have order!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really hate children. I will have order!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meaning?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's none of your business.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much for this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 5 Galleons.
- 5 Galleons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How much for me?
- 5 Galleons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 10 Galleons.
- 10 Galleons.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I reckon he's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...who don't want to be followed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quibbler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quibbler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quibbler.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who were all those people?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's happened. He's one of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're barking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hermione saw it with her own eyes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, I don't know what I saw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need some air.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...if I had to continue
for another 2 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that supposed to mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amused, Blaise?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll see just who's laughing in the end.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two go on.
I wanna check something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Harry?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Petrificus Totalus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finite.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I am your friend, Luna.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Names?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for 5 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No exceptions, Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are those people?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurors. For security.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this cane here, then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice face, Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like me to fix it for you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but it's up to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Episkey.
- Ah!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brilliant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you stop eating?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your best friend is missing!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's covered in blood again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where have you been?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened to your face?
- Later.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What've I missed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very best of evenings to you all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Horace Slughorn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...will be taken by Professor Snape.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snape?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, as you know...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you have the right to know why.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once there was a young man,
who, like you...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...sat in this very hall...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His name?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom Riddle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, of course...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...he's known all over the world
by another name.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every day, every hour...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...this very minute, perhaps...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just something to think about.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was cheerful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this can't be good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoying ourselves, are we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...with "Exceeds Expectations."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brilliant. Um...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna take Potions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attention to detail
in the preparation...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is the prerequisite of all planning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron Weasley, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get what you want from the cupboard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any ideas what these might be?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that would be Polyjuice Potion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's terribly tricky to make.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is Amortentia...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the most powerful
love potion in the world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For example, I smell...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...spearmint toothpaste.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it is more commonly referred to as...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least until the effects wear off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this is what I offer each of you today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...of sufficient quality to
claim this prize.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nevertheless, good luck to you all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the brewing commence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You crush it. Don't cut it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, really.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merlin's beard! It is perfect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So here we are, then, as promised.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One vial of Felix Felicis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use it well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry, you got my message. Come in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoying your classes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your activities
outside the classroom?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help wondering...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me. I was merely being curious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But enough chitchat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer lies here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you are looking at are memories.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This vial contains
the most particular memory...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...of the day I first met him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like you to see it, if you would.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom, you have a visitor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do, Tom?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a professor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wants me looked at.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They think I'm different.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, perhaps they're right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not mad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hogwarts is a school.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A school of magic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do things, can't you, Tom?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things other children can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can make things move
without touching them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can make animals do what I want
without training them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can make them hurt...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...if I want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm like you, Tom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm different.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prove it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can speak to snakes too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They find me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whisper things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that normal for someone like me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know, sir? Then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had, I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over time, while here at Hogwarts...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you guess
who that teacher might be?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I did not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he will not give it up easily.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want me to let him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Um...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...just to assess your strengths.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet! Please!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks. All right. Um...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because you
made the team last year...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard feelings?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Strapping guy like you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keepers need to be quick, agile.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I like my chances.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Weasley!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, Cormac!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ron!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confundus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't he brilliant?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's vile.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I haven't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The binding is fragile.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">... yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's true.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just like being with Hermione.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I was curious, so I went to...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The library.
- The library. And?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not there. Over here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, sit beside me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something to drink?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, bloody hell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slick git.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And snogging.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'd like to leave.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be serious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That happens to be my sister.
- So?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, and you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what brings you here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...for the select student or two.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would be welcome too, Granger.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to see you, Wallenby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you playing at?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get to know him?
- I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a little bit...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Katie, you don't know what it could be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harry.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As if.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I said.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said it was important
that she deliver it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for 6 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Severus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was cursed, wasn't she?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, she was cursed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was Malfoy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a very serious accusation, Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your evidence?
- I just know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You astonish with your gifts, Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what does she see in him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dean? He's brilliant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You called him a slick git
not 5 hours ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's smart, funny.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Attractive.
- Attractive?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hermione's got nice skin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never really thought about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, I suppose, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, be sure to give them both my best.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your uncle, Belby?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents are dentists.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They tend to people's teeth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needed 10 stitches.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I'm not usually late.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye. Bye-bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just admiring your hourglass.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A most intriguing object.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As to some of your classmates...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shelf, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was he like?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He killed my parents.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only natural
you should want to know more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not unlike others I've known.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not unlike yourself, in fact.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the monster existed...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...it was buried deep within.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, eh, Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have 2 Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he wearing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how was it, then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How was what?
- Your dinner party?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty boring, actually.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're meant to bring someone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck today, Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you'll be brilliant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have it your way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Juice?
- Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look dreadful, Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that why you put something
in his cup?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it a tonic?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liquid luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't drink it, Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, Ron! Do it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Whoo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really shouldn't have done it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't put it in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron only thought you did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charms spell. I'm just practicing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they're really good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does it feel, Harry?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you see Dean with Ginny?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see the way you look at her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my best friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oops.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this room's taken.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with the birds?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oppugno.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It feels like this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's chemical.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really couldn't care less.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...we should go together, as friends.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I think of that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you going with?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, it's a surprise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that girl over there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I am the Chosen One.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll ask someone I like.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never been to this part of the castle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I wear shoes to bed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neville.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't get into the Slug Club.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cormac? That's who you invited?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it would annoy Ron the most.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On second thoughts...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might keep Cormac at bay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, here he comes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think she just went to powder her nose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slippery little minx, your friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this I'm eating, by the way?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dragon balls.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so quick, Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Traveling where?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Slughorn, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He claims to have been
invited to your party.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll escort him out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Certainly, professor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swore to protect you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made the Unbreakable Vow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need protection.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was chosen. This is my moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Unbreakable Vow."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sure that's what Snape said?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Positive. Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, bloody hell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lovely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take your word for it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, the pudding's still here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it sounds mad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so he could find out
what he was up to?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're blinded by hatred.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are disappearing, Harry, daily.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We place our trust
in a handful of people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open up, you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you trust me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pie?
- Not for me, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to forgive Remus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It takes its toll, his condition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're being followed, all of us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not been easy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get my owl?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As for Draco Malfoy...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I know a bit more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think, from what you described...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...what you and Ron saw in summer...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the object
that Draco is so interested in...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is a vanishing cabinet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A vanishing cabinet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can transport you anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's still there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was delicious, Molly, really.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure you won't stay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remus?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has Ron gone to bed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... Not yet. No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoelace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merry Christmas, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merry Christmas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harry, no!
- Remus!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ginny!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You coming to get me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stupefy!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ginny!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Molly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's easy for them to get to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who I am, Hermione, all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my Won-Won.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to know
where you get your information.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how did you know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Intuition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gracious. Is it that time already?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other professors,
well, they're not like you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They might misunderstand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was in the library the other night...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in the Restricted Section...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called, as I understand it...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I beg your pardon?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confused?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be surprised if you weren't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't understand.
What happened?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is also a lie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This memory has been tampered with...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why would he tamper
with his own memory?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, indeed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...any way you can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know him that well, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This memory is everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without it, we are blind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no choice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must not fail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...with the chapter on antidotes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alys, don't forget your rat tail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To what do I owe this pleasure?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask away, dear boy, ask away.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Potions Master, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Um...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I mean to say is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...well, he's not like you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He might misunderstand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest you do the same.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's you, Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Divine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She could never annoy me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I love her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, brilliant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think she knows I exist?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope so. She's been snogging you
for 3 months.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snogging? Who are you talking about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you talking about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, very funny.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Can you introduce me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Romilda?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter with Wenby?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very powerful love potion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well. Better bring him in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps you're right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the questions about Voldemort.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't use that name.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened to me?
- Love potion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bloody strong one at that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we are, Potter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To life!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron. Professor, do something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ron, breathe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These girls, they're gonna kill me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The question is,
why were they necessary?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, indeed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This appears to be a gift, Horace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...when not polluted with poison.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To whom, I might ask?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To you, Headmaster.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she doing here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might ask you the same question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I happen to be his girlfriend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I happen to be his friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. See? He senses my presence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Hermione...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hermione.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hermione.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, come away, everybody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Weasley is well tended.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time, don't you think?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shut up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, well...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...she came to visit you
in the hospital.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you talked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just she seems a bit put out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, she does, doesn't she?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You say you don't remember
anything from that night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything at all?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Boggled.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Katie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Katie Bell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Katie. How are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been trying to remember, honestly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I just can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Katie?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sectumsempra!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to get rid of it. Today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take my hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Room of Requirement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...where no one will ever find it,
including you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that?
- What was that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never know what you'll find up here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close your eyes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did you and Ginny do it, then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, hide the book?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. Dear, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how do you feel?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really excellent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Slughorn usually eats early...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We have a plan.
- I know...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or Felix does.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merlin's beard, Harry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, just the general behavior, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My own interests
are purely academic, of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get out of the castle, Harry?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through the front door, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and I fancied paying him a visit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...back to the castle immediately!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be counterproductive, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what makes you say that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A dead one, I think, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to mention the pincers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I reckon that too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My thoughts exactly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Old Potions Master's habit, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a family, I trust?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Farewell...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aragog.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Farewell, Aragog...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...king of the arachnids.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your body will decay...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but your spirit lingers on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poof.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's life, I suppose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go along and then suddenly, poof!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Poof.
- Poof.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a student who gave me Francis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As I watched, it sank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just before it reached the bottom...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...it transformed...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...into a wee fish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was beautiful magic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wondrous to behold.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The flower petal had come from a lily.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The day I came downstairs...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the day the bowl was empty...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...was the day your mother...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know why you're here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't help you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would ruin me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know why I survived, professor?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The night I got this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because she sacrificed herself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because she refused to step aside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to tell you something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something others have only guessed at.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's true.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the Chosen One.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and I need to know what you told him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be brave, professor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be brave like my mother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, you disgrace her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, she died for nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've no idea what he was like,
even then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was in the library the other night...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in the Restricted Section...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called, as I understand it...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a Horcrux.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came across the term while reading...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and I didn't fully understand it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...why I came to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't understand
how that works, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Protected?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words, you cannot die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how does one split his soul, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murder.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't 7...?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To rip the soul into 7 pieces...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be our little secret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is beyond anything I imagined.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they exactly?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A ring, for example.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a book.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew this was
a different kind of magic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One destroys Voldemort.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">True. But magic, especially dark magic...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...leaves traces.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- When you leave the school?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I think perhaps
I may have found another.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...that you take too much for granted?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need a shave, my friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an old man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still look the same to me, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there is one condition:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must obey every command
I give you, without question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do understand what I'm saying?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I tell you to hide, you hide.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I tell you to run, you run.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your word, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take my arm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, being me has its privileges.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place has known magic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...payment must be made.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your blood's much more precious
than mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will have put certain defenses
in position.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only question is,
how do we get there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you would, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has to be drunk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it has to be drunk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This potion might paralyze me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might make me forget why I'm here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not to indulge these requests.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if you have to force it
down my throat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your good health, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor, can you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my fault.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all my fault.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my fault.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I promise I'll do what you say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I promise.
- No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did it, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aguamenti.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lumos.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lumos Maxima!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sectumsempra!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stupefy!
- Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Partis Temporus!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to your houses. No dawdling.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Severus. Severus is who I need.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake him. Tell him what happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speak to no one else.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Severus, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hide yourself below, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harry, do as I say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, Draco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else is here? I heard you talking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Draco...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done things that would shock you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me, Draco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...your heart can't really
have been in them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He trusts me. I was chosen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I shall make it easy for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Expelliarmus!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good. Very good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are others.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has a sister. A twin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ingenious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Draco...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you understand? I have to do this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to kill you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or he's gonna kill me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, look what we have here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, Draco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, Bellatrix.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think introductions
are in order, don't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me finish him in my own way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your moment. Do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, Draco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Severus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Avada Kedavra.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hagrid! Hello?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snape! He trusted you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incarcerous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fight back! You coward, fight back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sectumsempra!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the Half-Blood Prince.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Potter...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in light of what has happened...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you meant a great deal to him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think he would've done it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Draco?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he was lowering his wand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the end, it was Snape.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was always Snape.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I did nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you will be mortal once more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">R.A.B."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">R.A.B.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means it was all a waste.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron's okay with it, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and Ginny.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not coming back, Hermione.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't know where that'll lead me...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've always admired your courage, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But sometimes, you can be really thick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't really think
you're going to be able...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need us, Harry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never realized
how beautiful this place was.</font>
