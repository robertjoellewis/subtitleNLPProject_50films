<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, you have finally
lost your senses.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This venture is impossible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For some. Gentlemen, the only
way to achieve the impossible</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to believe it is possible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That kind of thinking
could ruin you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm willing to take that chance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine trading posts in
Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nightmare again?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't be long.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm falling down a dark hole,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I see strange creatures.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of creatures?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's a dodo bird, a rabbit
in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know cats could smile.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither did I.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's a blue caterpillar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blue caterpillar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think I've
gone round the bend?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid so. You're mad,
bonkers, off your head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you get too frightened, you
can always wake up. Like this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must we go?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doubt they'll notice
if we never arrive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will notice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your corset?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And no stockings.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm against them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're not properly dressed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's to say what is proper?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you wear it?
- Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To me, a corset is
like a codfish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, not today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father would have laughed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I'm tired. I
didn't sleep well last night.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you have bad dreams again?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's always the same, ever
since I can remember.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think that's normal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't most people have
different dreams?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. You're beautiful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, can you manage a smile?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At last. We thought
you'd never arrive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do realize it's
well past 4:00.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now everything will have
to be rushed through.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only Charles were here...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My condolences.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not. I'm pleased that
you purchased the company.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a fool for not investing in his
mad venture when I had the chance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles thought so, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish, do you ever
tire of quadrille?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary. I
find it invigorating.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I amuse you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a sudden vision of
all the ladies in trousers</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the men wearing dresses.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you'll do best to keep
your visions to yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When in doubt, remain silent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon us, sir. Miss Kingsleigh
is distracted today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your head?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was wondering what it
would be like to fly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you spend your time</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinking about such
an impossible thing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why wouldn't I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father said he sometimes
believed in 6 impossible things</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before breakfast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come along.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, meet me under the gazebo
in precisely 10 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a secret to tell you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're telling me, then
it's not much of a secret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we tell her, she
won't be surprised.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now you've brought
it up, you have to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if your mother knows</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's your mother right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish is going to
ask for your hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've ruined the surprise!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could strangle them!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone went to so much
effort to keep the secret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does everyone know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish will ask you under the
gazebo. When you say yes...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't know if I
want to marry Hamish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who, then? You won't
do better than a lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll soon be 20, Alice. That
pretty face won't last forever.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to end
up like Aunt Imogene.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you don't want to be a
burden on Mother, do you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you'll marry Hamish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will be as happy
as I am with Lowell,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your life will be perfect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's already decided.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll leave you to it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden, just you and me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what
I've always dreaded?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The decline of the aristocracy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugly grandchildren.
But you're lovely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're bound to produce
little... Imbeciles!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gardeners have
planted white roses</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I specifically
asked for red.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could always
paint the roses red.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What an odd thing to say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should know that my son has
extremely delicate digestion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you see that?
- See what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was a rabbit, I think.
- Nasty things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do enjoy setting
the dogs on them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you serve Hamish the wrong
foods, he could get a blockage.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see it that time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See what?
- The rabbit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't shout.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, pay attention. Hamish said
you were easily distracted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't be more interested,
but you'll have to excuse me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aunt Imogene.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm going mad. I keep
seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't be bothered with
your fancy rabbit now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm waiting for my fiance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You have a fiance?
- Hmm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There! Did you see it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a prince.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, alas, he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tragic, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lowell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice. We were just...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hattie's an old friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see you're very close.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you won't mention this
to your sister, will you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I'm confused.
I need time to think.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to ruin
her marriage, do you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm not the one who's
sneaking around behind her back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice Kingsleigh...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a caterpillar
on your shoulder.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't hurt it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll want to wash that finger.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice Kingsleigh,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will you be my wife?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everyone expects me to,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're a lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My face won't last, and I
don't want to end up like...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is happening
so quickly. I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think she would remember
all this from the first time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've brought
the wrong Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she's the right one.
I'm certain of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the wrong Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give her a chance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Curiouser and curiouser.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you she's
the right Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not convinced.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that for gratitude?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been up there for weeks,
trailing one Alice after the next,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I was almost eaten
by other animals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you imagine?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They go about entirely unclothed,
and they do their shukm in public.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I had to avert my eyes.
- Doesn't look anything like herself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because she's
the wrong Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- If she was, she might be.
- If she isn't, she ain't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But if she were so, she would be.
- But she isn't, nohow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I be the wrong Alice
when this is my dream?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who are you, if I might ask?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm Tweedledee,
he's Tweedledum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should consult Absolem.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly. Absolem will
know who she is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll escort you.
- Hey, it's not being your turn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So unfair.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, leave off!
- Let go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are they always this way?
- Family trait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can both escort her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who is this Absolem?
- He's wise. He's absolute.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's Absolem.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolem?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.
The question is, who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shall see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you ought, stupid girl.
Unroll the Oraculum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Oraculum, being a calendrical
compendium of Underland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a calendar.
- Compendium.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tells of each and every
day since the Beginning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today is Griblig Day in the
time of the Red Queen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show her the Frabjous Day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the
day you slay the Jabberwocky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry? Slay a what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. That being you,
there, with the Vorpal sword.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No other swords can kill
the Jabberwocky, nohow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it ain't Vorpal,
it ain't dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not hardly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I told you.
- Oh, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I said so.
- I said so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, you
said she might be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you said she
would be if she was.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little impostor. Pretending to
be Alice. She should be ashamed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was so certain of you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be the wrong Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, this is my dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to wake up now
and you'll all disappear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's odd. Pinching
usually does the trick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could stick you,
if that would help.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It might, actually.
- Thank you. My pleasure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bandersnatch!
- Bandersnatch!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a dream.
Nothing can hurt me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't hurt me. Can't hurt me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, you great lug!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way, east to Queast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, South to Snud.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no. This way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone has stolen
three of my tarts!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you?
- No, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you steal my tarts?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Squimberry juice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was so hungry! I didn't mean to!
- Off with his head!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My family! Oh, please,
please don't!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I have little
ones to look after!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to his house and
collect the little ones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love tadpoles on toast almost
as much as I love caviar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ilosovic Stayne, you knave,
where have you been lurking?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, I have
found the Oraculum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That? Looks so ordinary
for an oracle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look here, on the Frabjous Day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd know that tangled
mess of hair anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it Alice?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's she doing with
my darling Jabberwocky?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She appears to be slaying it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet, but it will happen
if we don't stop her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find Alice, Stayne. Find her!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the scent of human
girl and earn your freedom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For my wife and pups, as well?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone will go home.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dogs will believe anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like you ran afoul of
something with wicked claws.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm still dreaming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did that to you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Banner or Bander...
- The Bandersnatch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'd better have a look.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It needs to be purified by
someone with evaporating skills,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or it will fester and putrefy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather you didn't. I'll
be fine as soon as I wake up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least let me bind it for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Alice?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's been some debate about that.
- I never get involved in politics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd best be on your way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What way? All I want to do
is wake up from this dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll take you to the Hare and the
Hatter, but that's the end of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch what you're doing!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, watch it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not. McTwisp
brought us the wrong Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the wrong Alice!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's absolutely Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're absolutely Alice.
I'd know you anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd know him anywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as you can see,
we're still having tea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's all because I was obliged to
kill Time waiting for your return.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're terribly late, you know.
Naughty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, anyway, Time became quite
offended and stopped altogether.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a tick ever since.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cup.
- Time can be funny in dreams.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, yes, of course, but
now you're back, you see,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we need to get on
to the Frabjous Day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Frabjous Day!
- Frabjous Day!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm investigating things that
begin with the letter "M."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Down with the Bloody Big Head,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Bloody Big Head
being the Red Queen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, come. We simply must commence
with the slaying and such.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore, it is high time
to forgive and forget</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or forget and forgive,
whichever comes first</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or is, in any case, most
convenient. I'm waiting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. It's tick-tick...
It's ticking again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All this talk of blood and
slaying has put me off my tea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire world is falling to ruin
and poor Chessur's off his tea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened that day
was not my fault.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ran out on them to
save your own skin,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you guddler's scuttish pilgar lickering
shukm juggling sluking urpal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bar lom muck egg brimni!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Meow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with you, Tarrant? You
used to be the life of the party.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used to do the best
Futterwacken in all of Witzend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Futter what?
- Futterwacken!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the Frabjous Day,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the White Queen once
again wears the crown,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on that day, I shall
Futterwacken vigorously.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Knave.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hide her!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink this quickly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick! Hide her!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind your head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me out!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it's not my
favorite trio of lunatics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to join us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all late for tea!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're looking for the
girl called Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of the Queen, here is a little
song we used to sing in her honor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Twinkle Twinkle little bat.
- Twinkle Twinkle little bat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How I wonder where you're at.
- How I wonder where you're at.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Up a...
- Up a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're hiding her,
you'll lose your heads.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Already lost them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All together now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Up above the world you fly.
- Up above the world you fly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like a tea tray in the sky.
- Like a tea tray in the sky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like some cream?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you like a slice of Battenberg?
- Follow the bloodhound.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sugar?
- Yes, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, that's lovely.
- You're all mad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks very much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pass the scones, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That one there.
- Oh! Pardon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yep, aye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try this on for size.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good thing the bloodhound is
one of us, or you'd be...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do they want with me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute, best take
her to the White Queen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be safe there. Spoon...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your carriage, milady.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The hat?
- Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone can go by horse or rail,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the absolute best way to travel
is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I love traveling by hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mally. Just Alice, please.
Fairfarren, all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean? Wait. Gae!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, what was that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame
Jaws that bite and claws that catch!"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
And the frumious Bandersnatch!."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He took his Vorpal sword in hand The
Vorpal blade went snicker-snack!"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He left it dead, and with its
head He went galumphing back."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all about you, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not slaying anything. I don't
slay, so put it out of your mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! You can't leave me here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't slay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any idea what
the Red Queen has done?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't slay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't if I wanted to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the same
as you were before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were much more muchier.
You've lost your muchness.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My "muchness"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In there. Something's missing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me what Red Queen has done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a pretty story.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was hatter to the White
Queen at the time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hightopp clan have always
been employed at court.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter? Hatter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear that? I'm
certain I heard something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Red Knights.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go South to Trotter's Bottom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The White Queen's
castle is just beyond.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on tightly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down with the bloody Red Queen!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to lead them
away! The Hatter trusted you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have my wife and pups.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's your name?
- Bayard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would your name be
Alice, by any chance?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but I'm not the one that
everyone's talking about.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hatter would not have given
himself up just for any Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did they take him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the Red Queen's
castle at Salazen Grum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to rescue him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is not foretold.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care. He wouldn't be
there if it weren't for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Frabjous Day
is almost upon us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must prepare to
meet the Jabberwocky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the moment I fell
down that rabbit hole,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been told what I must
do and who I must be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been shrunk, stretched,
scratched and stuffed into a teapot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been accused of being Alice and of
not being Alice, but this is my dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll decide where
it goes from here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you diverge from the path...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I make the path.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard,
and don't forget the hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one way across.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lost my muchness, have I?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bayard! The hat!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Splendid shot!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my ball? Page!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to help you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it isn't
the wrong Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What brings you here? Mmm?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've come to rescue the Hatter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not rescuing anyone
being the size of a gerbil.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, do you have any more of that
cake that made me grow before?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Upelkuchen? Actually, I
might have some left.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all of it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't.
Don't do that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Page!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It... It's a "who," Majesty.
This is, um...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Umbradge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to your clothes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I outgrew them. I've been
growing an awful lot lately.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tower over everyone in
Umbradge. They laugh at me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I've come to you, hoping you
might understand what it's like.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dear girl,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">anyone with a head that large
is welcome in my court.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone find her some clothes!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use the curtains if you must,
but clothe this enormous girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a pig here!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love a warm pig belly
for my aching feet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would you like one, Um?
- No, thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go away.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fat boys!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. There they are.
Aren't they adorable?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have the oddest way of
speaking. Speak, boys. Amuse us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speak!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that being...
- No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, I believe it's so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it ain't so, nohow!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love my fat boys.
Now, get out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He did pinch me.
- He did pinch me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who is this lovely creature?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, my new favorite.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, does she have a name?
- Um.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe your name has
slipped the Queen's mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name is Um, idiot!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Umbradge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any luck with the prisoner?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's stubborn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're too soft. Bring him!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know Alice has
returned to Underland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know where she is?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been considering things
that begin with the letter "M."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moron, mutiny, murder, malice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're looking for an "A"
word now. Where is Alice?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who, that wee little boy?
I wouldn't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a regrettably
large head you have.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should very much
like to hat it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hat it?
- Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to hat the White
Queen, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't very much to
work with, poor dear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her head is so small.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tiny. It's a
pimple of a head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I could do with this
monument, this orb...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nay, this magnificently
heroic globe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What could you do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbind him, Stayne.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can he work if
his hands are bound?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, shall it be
a bonnet or a boater?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or something for the boudoir?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif,
snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter,
billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bongrace, fan-tail, night
cap, Garibaldi, fez...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fez?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The trees seem sad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have you been speaking with them?
- Yes, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps a bit more kindly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you all excuse me
for a moment? Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What news, Bayard?
- Alice has returned to Underland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is she now?
- In Salazen Grum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me. I allowed her to
divert from her destined path.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no. But that is exactly
where she will find the Vorpal sword.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have our champion. Rest now.
You've done well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you seen a
hat around here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must find Alice, Stayne.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without the Jabberwocky,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my sister's followers will
surely rise against me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugly little sister. Why do
they adore her and not me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot fathom it. You are
far superior in all ways.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Mirana can make anyone
fall in love with her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Men, women,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even the furniture.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even the King?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to do it. He
would have left me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, is it not better
to be feared than loved?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not certain anymore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, let her have the rabble.
I don't need them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're wonderful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must let me try one on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is good to be working
at my trade again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a pity you have
to make them for her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the hatter with me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm frightened, Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I gone mad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid so. You're
entirely bonkers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's better. You
look yourself again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hat man! Where are my hats?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a patient monarch!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm told she keeps the Vorpal
sword hidden in the castle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rabbit will help you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find it, Alice. Take
it to the White Queen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll go to the White
Queen together.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it you're always
too small or too tall?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tweedles.
- Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you do, again?
- Where's the rabbit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is it you're
being so great big?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She ain't great big, this
is how she normal is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm certain she's
smaller when we met.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she drank the pishsalver to
get through the door, recall it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's the rabbit?
- Over theres.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing here?
- I'm rescuing the Hatter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm rescuing the Hatter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told me that the Vorpal sword is
hidden in the castle. Help me find it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't take orders from
big, clumsy, galumphing...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is it, McTwisp?
- I know where the sword is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sword's hidden inside.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful, Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that smell.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going in there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what that thing
did to my arm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear, oh, dear. Why haven't
you mentioned this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't this bad before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter? Where are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mallymkun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you still have the
Bandersnatch eye?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need it.
- Come and get it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Give it back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like you, Um.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like largeness.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away from me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have your eye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look stunning in that hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Next.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty has
never looked better.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. Another.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wish to alarm you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it smells as though you
might have dropped something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind him, he's mad.
Come along.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stayne!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose this
makes us even now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um forced herself on me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told her my heart belongs to
you, but she's obsessed with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with her head!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand back, Mallymkun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's this for muchness?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no! It mustn't be
used for anything...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arrest that girl for
unlawful seduction!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take it to the White Queen.
- I'm not leaving without you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, Alice!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seize her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. Why didn't I see it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it has been a long time, and
you were such a little tyke then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give me the sword.
- Stay back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Queen will be so pleased.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will take great pleasure
in taking off your head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, Alice! Bayard!
- To Marmoreal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, Alice has escaped</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the Bandersnatch,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the Vorpal sword.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you let this happen?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may have underestimated her,
but we have her conspirators,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Hatter and a dormouse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with their heads!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Marmoreal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe this belongs to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Vorpal sword is home again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The armor is complete.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now all we need is a champion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a little taller
than I thought you'd be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blame it on too much upelkuchen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the March Hare here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're late for your
soup, you wee besom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're late for your soup.
- Could use some salt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that here. Choppy,
chop, chop, chop.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leek and potato. Yes.
That would be...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pishsalver. Let me think.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A pinch of worm fat,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">urine of the horsefly,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">buttered fingers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sister preferred to study
Dominion Over Living Things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, how does
she seem to you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfectly horrid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And her head?
- Bulbous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think she may have some
kind of growth in there,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something pressing on her brain.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three coins from a dead man's pocket,
two teaspoons of wishful thinking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't imagine the things
that go on in that place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, I can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when a champion steps forth
to slay the Jabberwocky,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the people will
rise against her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That should do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Feel better?
- Much, thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's someone here who would
like to speak with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Absolem?
- Who are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you know?
- You said so yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said you were
not hardly Alice,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you're much more her now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, you're almost Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even so,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky
if my life depended on it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I suggest you keep the
Vorpal sword on hand</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the Frabjous Day arrives.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem so real.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I forget that
this is all a dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you stop doing that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've always admired that hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Chess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since you won't be
needing it anymore,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would you consider
bequeathing it to me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a formal execution. I would
like to look my best, you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a pity about all this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was looking forward to
seeing you Futterwacken.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was rather good
at it, was I not?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really do love that hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would wear it to all
the finest occasions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love a morning
execution, don't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'd like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as I can
get at your neck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right behind you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with his head!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't watch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chess, you dog.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madam,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are being
heinously bamboozled</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by these lickspittle toadies
you surround yourselves with.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not the only one, Majesty.
Look!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A counterfeit nose. You
should be ashamed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? What about that big
belly you're so proud of?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with their heads!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The abused and enslaved
in the Red Queen's court,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of you stand up and fight!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rise up against the
bloody Red Queen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Release the Jubjub Bird!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right, Stayne,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is far better to
be feared than loved.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, boys. Quickly! Come on!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mally, quickly.
Come on. Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had hoped to have
a champion by now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you slay the
Jabberwocky yourself?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have the power.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is against my vows to
harm any living creature.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have company.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a look, Bayard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bielle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so happy to see you. I
thought they were going to...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did I. But they didn't, and now
here I am, still in one piece.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm rather glad about that
now that I'm seeing you again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would have regretted
not seeing you again,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">especially now that you're
you, and the proper size.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's a good size. It's a great
size. It's a right proper Alice size!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hatter. Size.
- Fez. I'm fine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your hat?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cheshire.
- How's the arm, love?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All healed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, sweet hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you any idea why a raven
is like a writing desk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me think about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what tomorrow
is, don't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Frabjous Day. How
could I forget?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish I'd wake up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Still believe this is a dream, do you?
- Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has all come
from my own mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which would mean
that I'm not real.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Afraid so. You're just a
figment of my imagination.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would dream up someone
who's half-mad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, yes. But you would have
to be half-mad to dream me up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must be, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll miss you when I wake up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who will step forth to be
champion for the White Queen?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be I.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have very poor evaporating
skills. I should be the one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, me.
- No, me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No other slayer, nohow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it ain't Alice,
it ain't dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, you cannot live your
life to please others.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The choice must be yours,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because when you step out
to face that creature,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will step out alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing was ever
accomplished with tears.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolem?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you upside down?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've come to the
end of this life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're going to die?
- Transform.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't go. I need your help.
I don't know what to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help you if you don't even
know who you are, stupid girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not stupid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Alice.
I live in London.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a mother named Helen
and a sister named Margaret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father was
Charles Kingsleigh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a vision that stretched
halfway around the world,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nothing ever stopped him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm his daughter. I'm
Alice Kingsleigh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, at last.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were just as dim-witted
the first time you were here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You called it "Wonderland,"
as I recall.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wonderland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Alice?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll take you to the Hare and the
Hatter, but that's the end of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Thackery, not at
the table, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have some tea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not Absolem, I'm
Absolem, stupid girl.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is this?
- I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think she would remember
all this from the first time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Curiouser and curiouser.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a dream at
all, it was a memory.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place is real, and so are
you and so is the Hatter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the Jabberwocky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, the Vorpal sword
knows what it wants.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you have to do
is hold on to it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fairfarren, Alice. Perhaps I
will see you in another life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, Iracebeth.
- Hello, Mirana.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On this, the Frabjous Day,
the Queens Red and White</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shall send forth their champions
to do battle on their behalf.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Racie. We don't
have to fight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're doing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you can blink
those pretty little eyes</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll melt, just like
Mummy and Daddy did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! It is my crown!
I am the eldest!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jabberwocky!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is impossible.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only if you believe it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I believe as many as
6 impossible things before breakfast.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is an excellent practice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, just at the moment,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you really might want to
focus on the Jabberwocky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your champion, Sister?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Um.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 impossible things.
Count them, Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, there's a potion
that can make you shrink.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2, and a cake that
can make you grow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, my old foe, we meet on
the battlefield once again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've never met.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not you, insignificant bearer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ancient enemy,
the Vorpal one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough chatter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, animals can talk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4, Alice,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cats can disappear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's a place
called Wonderland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can slay the Jabberwocky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off with your head!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill her!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you? Off with his head!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes against
Underland are worthy of death.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, that is
against my vows,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">therefore, you are
banished to the Outlands.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one is to show you any kindness,
or ever speak a word to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will not have a
friend in the world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, I hope you
bear me no ill will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are to join
Iracebeth in banishment</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from this day until
the end of Underland.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least we have each other.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, please! Kill me!
Please!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do not owe you a kindness.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take off my head!
- He tried to kill me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Majesty! Please! Please!
- He tried to kill me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I offer you my head!
- He tried to kill me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the Frabjous Day!
Callou! Callay!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood of the Jabberwocky. You
have our everlasting gratitude.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for your efforts
on our behalf...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will this take me home?
- If that is what you choose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could stay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What an idea. A crazy,
mad, wonderful idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are questions I have to
answer, things I have to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be back again
before you know it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't remember me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I will.
How could I forget?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hatter, why is a raven
like a writing desk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't the slightest idea.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fairfarren, Alice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She left me standing
there without an answer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A case of nerves, no doubt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Alice.
- Lord, Good Lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you all right?
- What happened to you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fell down a hole
and hit my head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's that trouble
with your digestion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Margaret, but this is my
life. I'll decide what to do with it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky to have my
sister for your wife, Lowell,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you be good to her. I'll
be watching very closely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no prince,
Aunt Imogene.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to talk to someone
about these delusions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Mother,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find something useful
to do with my life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two remind me of some
funny boys I met in a dream.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I have
business to discuss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we speak in the study?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. And one more thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't think he was
looking far enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not go all the way to China?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's vast, the culture is rich, and
we have a foothold in Hong Kong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be the first to trade with
China, can you imagine it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if anybody else
had said that to me,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say, "You've
lost your senses."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I've seen that look before.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as you're not going
to be my daughter-in-law,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perhaps you'd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Absolem.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tripping out, spinning around.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm underground I fell down.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah, I fell down.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm freaking out
Where am I now?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Upside down and I
can't stop it now.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can't stop me now.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I, I'll get by.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I, I'll survive.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground.</i></font>

Don't you try to stop me.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I, I won't cry.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I found myself in Wonderland.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Get back on my
feet, the ground.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is this real?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is it pretend?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'll take a stand
until the end.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I, I won't cry.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, Alice, dear,
where have you been?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So near, so far,
so in between.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What have you heard?
What have you seen?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alice, Alice, please, Alice.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, tell us, are
you big or small?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>To try this one
or try them all.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's such a long,
long way to fall.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alice, Alice, oh, Alice.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How can you know
this way, not that?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You choose the door
You choose the path.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Perhaps you should
be coming back.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Another day, another day.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And nothing is quite
what it seems.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're dreaming
Are you dreaming?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, Alice.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, how will you
find your way?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No time for tears today
No time for tears today.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So many doors, how
did you choose?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So much to gain,
so much to lose.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So many things
got in your way.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No time today, no time today.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Be careful not to
lose your head.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Remember what the
dormouse said.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alice!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Did someone pull
you by the hand?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How many Miles to Wonderland?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Please tell us so
we'll understand.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alice, Alice, oh, Alice.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, how will you
find your way?</i></font>
